<p><b>Motor Matt King.</b></p>

<p><b>Joe McGlory</b>, a young cowboy who proves himself a lad of worth
and character, and whose eccentricities are all on the humorous
side. A good chum to tie to&mdash;a point Motor Matt is quick to
perceive.</p>

who contrives to make himself valuable, perhaps invaluable.</p>

<p><b>Carl Pretzel</b>, an old chum who flags Motor Matt and more trouble
than he can manage, at about the same time. In the rôle of
detective, he makes many blunders, wise and otherwise, finding
success only to wonder how he did it.</p>

<p><b>Ben Ali</b>, an elephant driver; a Hindoo gifted in the arts for which
his country is famous and infamous. The uncle of Margaret
Manners, he revenges himself upon his brother, the rajah, in a
way that proves his own undoing.</p>

<p><b>Aurung Zeeb</b>, another elephant driver, and a friend of Ben Ali,
assisting in his scoundrelly work.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">"ON THE BANKS OF THE WABASH."</p>


<p>Strange, how a few harmless ingredients, thrown together
and mixed, will set the trouble pot a-boiling.</p>

<p>Saltpeter is an innocent and useful product, and so is
charcoal and sulphur; but seventy-five per cent. of the
first, fifteen per cent. of the second, and ten per cent. of
the third, when properly mixed, will make gunpowder&mdash;an
explosive that has slain millions, made kingdoms
over into republics, and changed the map of the world
again and again.</p>

<p>So, on this beautiful morning, with the banks of the
Wabash River for a setting, fate was juggling with a
few trifling elements for the purpose of combining them
and manufacturing trouble.</p>

<p>The Big Consolidated Shows were pitching their
tents near that part of the river, and two of the ingredients
that helped form the dangerous mixture were connected
with the "tented aggregation."</p>

<p>One was the big elephant, Rajah, who had a tremendous
thirst and was wabbling along toward the river
for a drink; the other was a Chinese boy, dipping a
couple of pails of water from the stream for the steam
calliope. The third element&mdash;the one having no connection
with the show&mdash;was a German youth with a weakness
for bursting into song.</p>

<p>The elephant, dryer than the desert of Sahara, was
making big and rapid tracks for the brightly gleaming
water, the Chinaman was leisurely filling his pails, and
the German was strolling along the bank, dusty from a
long tramp and with a stick over his shoulder from
which swung a bundle bound up in a knotted handkerchief.</p>

<p>If the German had known how to sing he would not
have attracted the attention of the Chinaman; and if the
Chinaman had not looked and grunted his disgust, the
German would not have become hostile; and if Rajah,
the elephant, had not possessed such a playful disposition,
the German and the Chinaman would probably have
separated with no more than a few mongrel words of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
personal opinion. But fate was working overtime that
day, and had an eye for weird combinations.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ach, der moon vas shining pright upon der Vabash,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From der fieldts dere comes some shmells oof new-mown hay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Droo der candlelight der sycamores vas gleaming,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On der panks oof der Vabash, righdt avay!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This was the German's song, and it sounded as though
it had been played on a fish horn. The Chinaman could
be seen to shiver as he deposited a pailful of water on
the bank, straightened erect, and looked at the singer.
There was that in his slant eyes which brought the German
to a halt.</p>

<p>"Don'd you like der song, shink?" demanded the
Dutchman, pushing out his chin in an irritating way.</p>

<p>"Woosh!" snorted the Chinaman, "you makee sing all
same like poodle dog makee howl."</p>

<p>"Py shiminy," cried the Dutchman, "I fight pedder as
I sing. I don'd let no monkey mit a pigdail make some
foolishness mit me."</p>

<p>"Dutchy boy clazy," declared the Celestial.</p>

<p>"I nefer liked der shinks anyways," went on the other,
dropping his stick and his bundle. "Dey vas sheap
skates, you bet you, und vas alvays taking avay goot
shobs from American fellers. I vill tie you oop in some
bowknots mit your pigdail und trop you py der rifer.
Yah, so."</p>

<p>"Dutchy boy makee spell 'able,'" and the Chinaman,
with supreme contempt, picked up his empty pail.</p>

<p>"You peen afraidt mit yourseluf!" shouted the Dutchman.</p>

<p>"My plenty busy; makee cally water fo' calliope. No
gottee time to fight. Come 'lound after palade, China
boy makee Dutchy boy suppa' fo' lion."</p>

<p>"Dot's me," breathed the Dutchman, picking up his
stick and bundle. "I'll be aroundt after dot barade, you
bed my life, und I don'd make some subber for der lion,
neider."</p>

<p>He started on slowly.</p>

<p>Unnoticed by either of the boys, the mahout on Rajah's
neck had kept the elephant close to the river bank. The
mahout was dozing, and Rajah was filling the piece of
hose, more generally known as his trunk, with Wabash
water and squirting it into his open mouth.</p>

<p>Now, Rajah was an eccentric elephant. There were
times when he was full of mischief and playful, and
other times when the wild jungle blood got the upper
hand of him and he became dangerous.</p>

<p>On two or three occasions, when Old Ben, the African
lion, had tried to mix things with the royal Bengal
tiger, Rajah had been called in to separate the fighters
with a well-directed stream, hurled with catapult force
from his trunk.</p>

<p>Rajah's cunning little eyes had been taking in the
quarrel between the Dutchman and the Chinaman. Something
prompted him to elevate his trunk and throw a
stream after the retreating Dutch boy.</p>

<p>The lad was knocked off his feet, his stick going one
way and his bundle the other. He jumped to his feet,
spluttering, and whirled around.</p>

<p>Rajah was innocently squirting a dozen or more gallons
of the river into his capacious throat, but the Chinaman,
the empty pail still in his hand, was laughing so that
he almost fell off the bank.</p>

<p>It was the most natural thing in the world for the
Dutch boy, in the excitement of the moment, to lay the
whole blame on the Chinese boy's shoulders.</p>

<p>The Dutchman had not seen Rajah use his trunk, and
the Chinaman had. It was very laughable, and the
Chinaman's cackling mirth was unrestrained.</p>

<p>The Dutchman saw only the empty bucket in the
Chinaman's hand, and it seemed certain the deluge of
water had come from the bucket.</p>

<p>"I gif you fits for dot, py shiminy!" whooped the
Teuton.</p>

<p>"No can do!" declared the Celestial.</p>

<p>The Dutchman came on with a bound, his dripping
clothes sprinkling everything in his vicinity.</p>

<p>The Chinaman threw the bucket. The other dodged.
The bucket sailed on through the air and struck Delhi,
Rajah's mate, a sharp rap on her big, fanning ear. Delhi
trumpeted loudly and started furiously after the boys.</p>

<p>Both the Chinaman and the Dutchman, their faculties
completely wrapped up in their quarrel, gave no attention
to the elephants. Coming together like a thousand of
brick, they clinched and wrestled back and forth on the
bank.</p>

<p>Delhi, wild with anger, gave no heed to the fierce
prodding of her mahout, but rushed onward, her trunk
stretched eagerly ahead of her and twitching and curving
in its desire to lay hold of the struggling youngsters.</p>

<p>For a second the prospect was very dark for the
Teuton and the Celestial. What would have happened
to them is problematical if Delhi had had her way. But
the big brute was not allowed to work her will. Rajah
interfered; not out of any desire to be of help to the
boys, but rather to assist his mate in securing vengeance.</p>

<p>Quickly Rajah aimed his trunk and hurled a stream of
water. The jet struck the two boys, lifted them from
their feet, and hurled them into the river. The lads were
tossed from the bank in just the nick of time. Hardly
were they clear of the spot where they had been wrestling
when Delhi's disappointed trunk swept over it.</p>

<p>Rajah's mahout, of course, had aroused himself, and
he and the other man got busy bringing the elephants
into subjection.</p>

<p>The Dutchman and the Chinaman had fallen into deep
water. It was necessary to disentangle themselves from
each other in order to swim and keep from being
drowned.</p>

<p>As Delhi backed away from the water's edge, under the
blows of her mahout's sharp, steel prod, she flung the
Dutchman's bundle and stick at the thrashing forms in
the water, and followed these with the buckets.</p>

<p>"I can do oop a shink mit vone hand," gurgled the
Dutchman, as his dripping head appeared above the surface
of the river; "aber ven a goople oof elephants iss
rung indo der game, den I don'd&mdash;&mdash; Wow!"</p>

<p>The handkerchief bundle, hurled with terrific force,
struck him on the head and sent him under.</p>

<p>"Dutchy boy no good!" spluttered the Chinaman.
"Him velly fine false alarm&mdash;&mdash; Woosh!"</p>

<p>One of the buckets hit the Celestial in the small of the
back and he vanished in a flurry of bubbles. When he
and the Dutchman again reappeared, Delhi and Rajah
were under control and no further danger threatened.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you two kids?" cried Delhi's
mahout, excited and angry.</p>

<p>"Der shink drew some vater on me," answered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
Dutchman, "und made more monkey-doodle pitzness dan
I vould shtand for."</p>

<p>"Him no savvy," declared the Chinese. "El'fant makee
thlow water."</p>

<p>Rajah's mahout was a Hindoo. In a queer jargon of
broken English, he described the way Rajah had hosed
down the Dutchman as the latter was walking off.</p>

<p>The other mahout lost his wrath in a flood of merriment.</p>

<p>"It's all a mistake!" he called. "Come out o' the wet
and stop your foolishness. If ye try to do any more
fightin', I'll set Delhi onto you ag'in."</p>

<p>The Dutchman labored ashore with his stick and his
bundle, and the Chinaman followed with his buckets.</p>

<p>"What do you s'pose Motor Matt would think of this,
Ping?" went on the mahout. "If he&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But what the mahout was intending to say was lost
in a roar of amazement and delight from the Dutchman.</p>

<p>"Vat's dot? Modor Matt? Vere he iss, anyvay? Say,
I vas his bard, und I peen looking for him efery blace,
longer as I can dell. Shpeak, vonce! Vere iss Modor
Matt?"</p>

<p>"China boy Motol Matt's pard," spoke up the dripping
Ping. "My workee fo' Motol Matt; Dutchy boy no
workee."</p>

<p>"Py shiminy, I dell you some more dot I peen Carl
Pretzel," shouted the Dutchman, "und dot I vas looking
for der show, und ditn't know I vould findt Modor Matt
at der same dime. Vere iss he, misder?" and Carl appealed
anxiously to the mahout.</p>

<p>"He's travelin' with the show, youngster," answered
the mahout, "an' doin' a flyin'-machine stunt twice a day.
If ye want to find him, hike for the show grounds."</p>

<p>Without paying any further attention to Ping or the
elephants, Carl gathered in his cap&mdash;which lay at the
water's edge, and was the only thing belonging to him
that was not dripping wet&mdash;and laid a rapid course for
the top of the bank.</p>

<p>Ping, filling the pails, started after Carl, worrying not
a little over this new pard of Motor Matt's who had
appeared so unexpectedly on the scene.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">IN THE CALLIOPE TENT.</p>


<p>"I don't like it, pard, and you can bet your moccasins
on that," said Joe McGlory.</p>

<p>"There are a whole lot of things about this business
I don't fancy," returned Motor Matt; "but we're under
contract, Joe, and Boss Burton says he'll give us an
extra fifty a week if we do the trick."</p>

<p>"But the girl! What's her notion about it? Hanging
to a trapeze under the aëroplane isn't a stunt to be
sneezed at."</p>

<p>"She's anxious to do the trick. She'll get fifty dollars
a week for it, and the money looks good to her."</p>

<p>"There's the danger, pard. Her neck's worth more
than fifty plunks a week."</p>

<p>"She's a little brick, that Haidee&mdash;pure grit. I'll see
that she's not placed in much danger."</p>

<p>"You'll have your hands full looking after yourself
and the aëroplane. Sufferin' whirligigs! You know how
hard it is to manage the <i>Comet</i> when there's a weight
suspended beneath."</p>

<p>"I can do it," declared Matt.</p>

<p>"Of course you can do, old socks&mdash;you can do anything
when you set your mind to it. But, tell me this,
what has that old elephant driver, Ben Ali, got to do
with Haidee? Ben Ali's a Hindoo, and Haidee is almost
as white as an American girl."</p>

<p>"Ben Ali's her uncle, Joe. Haidee's mother was Ben
Ali's sister, and Haidee's father was an English officer
living in Bombay. The girl told me all this yesterday
at the time she begged me to do what Boss Burton
wanted and let her trail the <i>Comet</i> aloft on the trapeze."</p>

<p>"Funny combination," muttered Joe.</p>

<p>McGlory was in his overclothes, and had just finished
getting the aëroplane ready for the parade. The "animal
top"&mdash;that is, the menagerie tent&mdash;had been hoisted, and
the small canvas lean-to that housed the steam calliope
had been put in place alongside. The calliope was not
in the lean-to, but was out on the grounds, being put
in shape for the parade.</p>

<p>Matt and Joe usually came to the calliope tent to
make themselves ready for the street procession. They,
together with Ping, had been three weeks with the Big
Consolidated, Matt making ascensions in the aëroplane
twice daily, following the parade and just before the
evening performance&mdash;wind and weather permitting. So
proficient had Matt become in handling the flying machine
that nothing short of a stiff gale or a hard rain
kept him from carrying out his engagements for a double
exhibition each day.</p>

<p>The aëroplane had caught the popular fancy, and had
proved the biggest kind of a card for Boss Burton,
proprietor of the show. Under its own motive power, the
machine formed a star feature of the parade, traveling
slowly on the bicycle wheels which were necessary in
giving it a start when flights were made.</p>

<p>From tip to tip, the wings of the aëroplane measured
more than thirty feet. Of course it could not travel in
the parade with such a stretch of surface across the
streets, so Matt had arranged the bicycle wheels in such
a manner that the <i>Comet</i> moved sideways in the procession,
the king of the motor boys, his cowboy pard,
and his Chinese comrade occupying positions in the seats
on the lower wing.</p>

<p>When Matt and his friends first joined the outfit, Boss
Burton had supplied them with bespangled apparel,
which, if they had worn it, would, according to McGlory,
have made them "a holy show."</p>

<p>Matt and McGlory balked at the glittering costumes,
but Ping had hung to his beadwork and gilt trimmings
with a fierce determination there was no shaking.</p>

<p>McGlory compromised with Burton by getting into a
swell cowboy rig, but for Matt there was no such thing
as compromise. This engagement with the show was
purely a business proposition, and he refused to make
a spectacle out of himself. He looked well, too, in his
unostentatious blue cap and clothes, and was given many
a cheer as the aëroplane pitched and shivered along in
the procession.</p>

<p>Boss Burton was a shrewd manager, and it was said
that he lay awake nights while section two of the show
train was making its jumps between stands, thinking
up new acts that would thrill the patrons of the Big
Consolidated. His last idea was to hitch a trapeze to
the bottom of the aëroplane, and have Haidee, Ben Ali's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
pretty niece, perform on the flying bar while Matt was
man&oelig;uvring the <i>Comet</i> over the show grounds.</p>

<p>It was this new wrinkle that had drawn objections
from McGlory when he and Matt had retired to the
calliope tent to make ready for the parade.</p>

<p>About all Matt had to do to get ready was to wash
and brush himself. McGlory, on the other hand, had
to get into a blue shirt, corduroy trousers, "chaps,"
tight, high-heeled boots, and a broad-brimmed sombrero.</p>

<p>"What's become of Ping?" asked Matt, stepping to
the tent flap and looking off over the busy grounds.</p>

<p>It would be an hour before the parade could start,
and the bright sun glowed over a scene of feverish activity.
The side-show tents, the stable tents, and cook
tent were already up. A small army of men was working
on the circus "top," and the rhythmical thump of
mauls on tent stakes could be heard on every hand.
Horses in two, four, six, and eight-horse teams were
moving about; band wagons, cages, and chariots were
being dusted and cleaned; the painted banners in front
of the side-show were being laced to their guys; the
candy "butchers" were getting their places in readiness,
and throughout the various occupations of the men ran
an orderly disorder, everywhere noticeable.</p>

<p>But Matt could see nothing of Ping, and he turned
away to where McGlory, his foot on an overturned
bucket, was buckling a big-roweled Mexican spur to his
heel.</p>

<p>"Ping is always promptness itself in getting into his
tinsel frills and furbelows," remarked Matt, "and I
can't understand what's keeping the boy so late this
morning."</p>

<p>"He's been put on the steam calliope, pard," laughed
McGlory, dropping his foot from the bucket and stamping
until the rowel jingled. "Little Squinch-eye seems
to have fallen in love with that bunch of steam whistles.
He tried to play 'Yankee Doodle' on the pipes, in Indianapolis,
and had almost stampeded the elephants before
the calliope man could choke him off. Sufferin' jangles,
pard, you never heard such a sound."</p>

<p>Before Matt could make any response, a soft voice
called from outside:</p>

<p>"Motor Matt! Can I come in a minute?"</p>

<p>"Sure," replied Matt heartily.</p>

<p>A lithe, graceful form, in velvet and spangles, leaped
lightly through the opening.</p>

<p>"Haidee!" exclaimed Matt, staring.</p>

<p>The girl bowed laughingly and threw a kiss, just as
she was in the habit of doing after her trapeze work
in the "big top."</p>

<p>"Yes, friends," she answered; "Haidee, the Flying
Marvel, who is to do a turn on Motor Matt's flying
machine just before the doors open. I am also to ride
on the top wing of the <i>Comet</i> during the parade. Will
I do?"</p>

<p>Lifting her arms, she pirouetted around for the observation
of the boys, then paused and smiled bewitchingly.</p>

<p>"Do?" cried McGlory. "Why, sis, you'll be the hit
of the piece. All I hope"&mdash;and McGlory's face went
rather long&mdash;"is that you and Matt come through your
trip in the air without any trouble."</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid!" declared Haidee.</p>

<p>"No more you're not, sis. If you were riding on
the lower wing with Matt the whole game would be
different; but you're to hang under the machine, and
there'll be more pitching and plunging than if you were
aboard a bucking bronk. Hang on, that's all, and don't
try to hang by your heels."</p>

<p>"I'll get an extra fifty dollars a week!" cried the
girl.</p>

<p>It was plain to be seen that she placed great store on
that "fifty dollars a week."</p>

<p>"What does your uncle, Ben Ali, think of it, Haidee?"
asked Matt.</p>

<p>A barely perceptible frown crossed the girl's face.
What was passing in her mind? Whatever her thoughts
were, they found no echo in her answer.</p>

<p>"Uncle Ben is glad to have me do it," and Haidee
retreated toward the door.</p>

<p>"Have you seen Ping, Haidee?" inquired Matt.</p>

<p>"When I saw him last," was the response, "he was
walking toward the river with a couple of buckets. I'll
be going, now. I'll see you again when the parade
starts. That trapeze act on the aëroplane will make a
great hit, don't you think?"</p>

<p>"It ought to," said Matt.</p>

<p>The girl vanished.</p>

<p>"I'll walk over to the steam music box," remarked
McGlory, "and see if I can spot our pigtail friend."</p>

<p>"All right," returned Matt, dropping down on an
overturned bucket and pulling a pencil and memorandum
book from his pocket.</p>

<p>Before he could begin to figure, he heard a voice addressing
McGlory at the tent door&mdash;and it was a voice
that brought him up rigidly erect and staring.</p>

<p>"Say, misder, iss dis der shteam cantalope tent?"</p>

<p>McGlory laughed.</p>

<p>"Well, yes, Dutchy, you've made a bull's-eye first
clatter. Here's where they keep the 'cantalope.' What's
the matter with you? Look like you'd gone in swimming
and forgotten to take off your clothes."</p>

<p>"I tropped in der rifer mit meinseluf, und id vas
vetter as I t'ought. Say, vonce, iss Modor Matt aroundt
der blace?"</p>

<p>"He's inside, and&mdash;&mdash; Sufferin' whirlwinds, but you're
in a hurry!"</p>

<p>A bedraggled form, with a dripping bundle in one
hand and a stick in the other, hurled itself through the
opening with a yell.</p>

<p>"Matt! Mein olt pard, Matt!"</p>

<p>The next instant Carl Pretzel had rushed forward
and twined his water-soaked arms about the king of the
motor boys. The Dutchman's delight was of the frantic
kind, and he gurgled and whooped, and blubbered, and
wrestled with Matt in a life-and-death grip.</p>

<p>McGlory, in amazement, watched from the entrance.</p>

<p>"Carl!" exclaimed Matt. "By all that's good, if it
isn't Carl! Great spark plugs, old chap, where did you
drop from?"</p>

<p>"Ach, from novere und eferyvere. Vat a habbiness!
I peen so dickled mit meinseluf I feel like I vas going
to pust! My olt raggie, Matt, vat I ain'd seen alreddy
for a t'ousant years!"</p>

<p>Just then there was a rush behind McGlory, and
some one nearly knocked him over getting into the tent.</p>

<p>"My workee fo' Motol Matt!" shrilled a high, angry
voice. "Dutchy boy no workee!"</p>

<p>Ping was terribly hostile, but McGlory caught and
held him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>Carl tore himself loose from Matt and would have
rushed at Ping had he not been restrained.</p>

<p>"Looks like they'd both been in the river," remarked
McGlory.</p>

<p>"What's the trouble here, boys?" asked Matt.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">AN EAVESDROPPER.</p>


<p>Both Carl and Ping tried to explain matters at the
same time. Each talked loud, in the hope of drowning
out the other, and the jargon was terrific. Finally McGlory
got a hand over the Chinaman's mouth, and Carl
was able to give his side of the question. After that,
Ping had his say.</p>

<p>"There's been no cause whatever for this flare-up,"
said Matt. "Everybody knows that Carl can't sing, but
everybody who's acquainted with him, too, knows that
he's got more pluck to the square inch than any fellow
of his size. Carl's all right, Ping. He went around
South America with Dick Ferral and me on that submarine,
and we parted company in San Francisco just
before I met up with Joe. Shake hands," and Matt
pushed Carl toward the Chinaman.</p>

<p>"My workee fo' Motol Matt," whispered Ping, who
had likewise been given a push by the cowboy; "Dutchy
boy no workee, huh?"</p>

<p>"You're both pards of mine," said Matt, "and you've
got to be friends. Now, shake hands."</p>

<p>The shaking was done&mdash;rather hesitatingly, it is true,
but nevertheless it was done.</p>

<p>"Now," went on Matt, "you get into your regalia,
Ping. Carl, you can get out of your wet clothes and
put on Joe's working suit. While you're about it, tell
me how you happen to be here. You stay and listen,
Joe," the young motorist added. "I want you to like
Carl as well as I do."</p>

<p>"That's me, pard," laughed McGlory, taking a seat
on one of the buckets. "There's plenty of ginger in
the Dutchman, and that's what cuts the ice with me."</p>

<p>Ping, covertly watching and listening, moved over to
his bag of clothes and began rigging himself out in his
gorgeous raiment. Carl, talking as he worked, removed
his water-logged costume.</p>

<p>"I vas a tedectif, Matt," said he gravely.</p>

<p>"What's that?" demanded McGlory.</p>

<p>"Detective," smiled the king of the motor boys. "My
Dutch pard has been making a sleuth out of himself."</p>

<p>"Yah, so," pursued Carl. "Tick Verral vent off mit
his uncle, in Tenver, und I run avay to San Francisco
looking for Matt. He don'd vas dere some more, und I
can't find oudt nodding aboudt vere he vas gone. I haf

<p>"How much have you made at the business, Carl?"
queried Matt.</p>

<p>"Vell, nodding, so far as I haf gone, Matt. Aber I
don'd haf no luck mit it. I vas schust learning der
ropes. A feller hat his money took avay in 'Frisco. I

afder dose fellers, und afder I was t'rown from der
office a gouple oof times I valked in on dem by der
fire escape. Den dey gif me some chobs."</p>

<p>"What sort of a job did they give you, Carl?"</p>

<p>By that time the Dutch boy had stripped and put on
McGlory's clothes. Reaching for his water-logged bundle,
he untied it, and fished a folded newspaper from
an assortment of rubber collars, socks, and red cotton
handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>The newspaper was very damp, and had to be handled
with care.</p>

<p>"Dis iss some English papers, Matt," explained Carl.
"Id vas brinted in Lonton, und dose tedectif fellers had
him py deir office. How mooch iss a t'ousant pounds
in Unidet Shtates money, hey?"</p>

<p>"Five thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"Veil, dot's der chob&mdash;making dot fife t'ousant. I bet
you I get rich vone oof dose tays."</p>

<p>"You have to do something, don't you, before you get
the money?" queried McGlory, with a wink at Matt.</p>

<p>"Ach, dot's nodding," answered Carl, in a large, offhand
manner. "Readt dot, Matt."</p>

<p>Matt took the wet newspaper and read a marked
paragraph, which ran as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"£1,000 Reward! This sum will be paid for any information
concerning one Margaret Manners, last known
to be in Calcutta, India. Miss Manners is about eighteen
years of age, and is the only daughter of the late Captain
Lionel Manners, of the English Army, stationed
at Bombay. Miss Manners disappeared from her home,
under mysterious circumstances, and it is possible she
went to America and engaged in the circus business.
Any one with knowledge concerning the missing person,
and desirous of obtaining the reward, will please communicate
with Arthur Hoppleson, Solicitor, 10 Kent's
Road, London, W. C. Further information, which cannot
be publicly printed, will be cheerfully furnished."</p></blockquote>

<p>Motor Matt, after reading the paragraph to himself,
read it aloud.</p>

<p>"Why," grinned McGlory, "that outfit of detectives
was working your German friend, Matt. They gave
him that and sent him on a wild-goose chase, just to
get rid of him."</p>

<p>"Dot's a misdake," declared Carl. "Dose fellers saw
I meant pitzness, py shinks, und dey gif me der hardest
case dey hat. Yah, so. Since den I haf peen looking
for shows. Eferyvere I hear aboudt some shows I hike
avay. Aber I don'd findt Miss Manners. She don'd
vas in der mooseums, oder in der Vild Vest shows, or in
Rinklings; und oof she vasn't in der Pig Gonsolidated,
den I vas oop some shtumps. My money has blayed
oudt, und I hat to rite in a pox car to Lafayette,

elephant shpeak about Motor Matt. Den I don'd t'ink
oof nodding more. I come, so kevick as bossiple, to
findt my olt raggie. Und here ve vas, togedder like ve
used to be." A broad smile covered Carl's face. "Now
I don'd care for nodding. Oof you t'ink you could
help me findt Miss Manners, den I vill be opliged, und
gif you part oof der revard&mdash;a gouple oof pounds oof
id, anyvay."</p>

<p>"It looks to me, Carl," said Matt, handing back the
paper, "as though the men in that detective office were
trying to have some fun with you. Have you written
to London to secure further information?"</p>

<p>Carl looked startled.</p>

<p>"Vell," he admitted, "I ditn't t'ink oof dat."</p>

<p>"You're a fine detective, you are," said Matt. "You
might as well hunt for a needle in a haystack as to hunt
for this English girl. Can't you see? You've got a
pretty wide field to cover, and it is only <i>supposed</i> that
she came to America and engaged in the circus business."</p>

<p>Carl ran his fingers through his carroty hair.</p>

<p>"Meppy dot's right," he mused. "Oof dose fellers in
Chicago vas making some monkey-doodle pitzness mit
me, you bed you I vould like to fool dem. Meppy I
findt der girl. Den vat? V'y, dose tedectif fellers feel
like t'irty cent. You vas vorking for der show, Matt?"</p>

<p>"We've an engagement with the manager for making
flights in our aëroplane."</p>

<p>"Vat's dose?"</p>

<p>"What's an aëroplane? Why, Carl, it's a heavier-than-air
flying machine."</p>

<p>"So? Und you go oop in id?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Carl sat on a bucket and ruminated for a space.</p>

<p>"You know pooty near efery vone dot vorks for der
show, hey?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know every one."</p>

<p>"Iss dere a girl mit der name oof Markaret Manners?"</p>

<p>"No. But she'd have a different name if she was
with a show, Carl. Performers hardly ever use their
real names."</p>

<p>"Dot's righdt, too." Once more Carl ran his fingers
through his mop of hair. "Iss der any vone connected
mit der show vat has a shtrawperry mark on der arm?"
he asked, brightening.</p>

<p>"Strawberry mark on the arm?" repeated Matt.
"Why, Carl, that advertisement doesn't say anything
about such a thing."</p>

<p>"I know dot, aber efery young laty you read aboudt
vat's lost has der shtrawperry mark on der&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>McGlory let off a roar of laughter. Carl straightened
up with a pained look on his fat face.</p>

<p>"Carl," cried McGlory, "you're a great sleuth, and no
mistake! You jump at too many conclusions."</p>

<p>"Dere don'd vas anyt'ing else to chump ad," returned
Carl. "Dis vas a dark case, you bed you, und dere has
to be some guessings. Dot's vat I make now, der guessings."</p>

<p>"Pretty woolly guessing, at that, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>McGlory broke off abruptly to follow a sudden movement
on Matt's part. The canvas forming the side of
the menagerie tent had shaken, as though there was
some one on the other side of it. Matt, seeing the
shiver of the canvas, leaped for the wall. The next
moment he had lifted the canvas and was looking into
the other tent.</p>

<p>A tall, brown-faced man, wearing a turban and an
embroidered jacket, was just vanishing through the tent
entrance. Matt dropped the canvas and turned away,
a thoughtful look taking the place of the smile with
which he had listened to Carl's talk.</p>

<p>"What was it, pard?" asked McGlory.</p>

<p>"An eavesdropper," replied Matt.</p>

<p>"Speak to me about that!" exclaimed McGlory. "If
some one thought the Dutchman's yarn worth listening
to, then perhaps there's something in it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps." Motor Matt's brow wrinkled perplexedly.</p>

<p>"Who was the fellow? Could you recognize him?"</p>

<p>"It was Ben Ali."</p>

<p>McGlory bounded up, excited, and his own face reflecting
some of the perplexity that shone in his friend's.</p>

<p>Before the conversation could be continued, however,
a man thrust his head into the calliope tent.</p>

<p>"They're waiting for you fellows," he announced.
"Hustle!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">QUEER PROCEEDINGS.</p>


<p>The place occupied by the aëroplane in the procession
was almost at the end, and just behind the herd of
four elephants. Rajah, owing to his freakish disposition,
was always the fourth elephant of the string, Delhi
his mate, immediately preceding him. With peaceable
brutes ahead, Rajah might usually be depended upon
not to cut any capers.</p>

<p>It will be seen from this that the <i>Comet</i> followed on
the heels of Rajah.</p>

<p>The parade was almost in readiness for the start when
Matt, McGlory, and Ping reached the aëroplane. Hostlers
were running about placing plumes in the head-stalls
of the horses, drivers were climbing to their seats,
the wild animal trainer was getting into the open cage,
and the members of the band were tinkering with their
instruments.</p>

<p>Haidee was standing by the aëroplane when Matt, McGlory,
and Ping reached the machine.</p>

<p>"All ready, Haidee?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>The girl turned and looked at him blankly. Her face
was unusually white, and there was a vacant stare in her
eyes.</p>

<p>"What's to pay, sis?" asked McGlory, with a surprised
look at Matt. "Don't you feel well?"</p>

<p>"I am well."</p>

<p>The words came in an unnatural voice and with parrot-like
precision.</p>

<p>Boss Burton came hustling down the line in his runabout.</p>

<p>"Hurry up, Matt," he called. "Help Haidee to a place
on the upper wing of the <i>Comet</i>."</p>

<p>Matt stepped over to the runabout.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with the girl?" he asked, in a
low tone.</p>

<p>"Matter?" echoed Burton, fixing a keen look on the
girl. "By Jupiter, she's got one of her spells again!
She hasn't had one of those for a month, now, and I
thought they'd about left her for good."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is she subject to spells of that kind?"</p>

<p>"She used to be. There's something queer about them,
but they don't last long."</p>

<p>"We shouldn't put her on the upper wing, then.
There's no seat there, and nothing to hold on to."</p>

<p>The sharp, impatient notes of a trumpet came from
the head of the line.</p>

<p>"Well, put her somewhere," said Burton impatiently,
and whirled his horse.</p>

<p>"Get on the top plane, Ping," said Matt, hurrying back
to the <i>Comet</i>. "Haidee is going to ride on the lower
wing with us."</p>

<p>"Awri'," chirped Ping, and McGlory gave him a
leg up.</p>

<p>Haidee, moving like an automaton, made no objection
to this arrangement. She took her place obediently on
the lower wing of the machine, between Matt and McGlory,
and the engine was started.</p>

<p>When the elephants began to move, Matt switched the
power into the bicycle wheels, and the aëroplane lurched
over the uneven ground. Reaching the road, the <i>Comet</i>
went more steadily; and when the procession wound into
the paved thoroughfares, the movement was comparatively
easy.</p>

<p>Ben Ali, from the neck of Rajah, kept turning around
and looking back at the three on the lower plane of the
<i>Comet</i>.</p>

<p>Matt, McGlory, and Haidee, on account of the wings
of the aëroplane being turned lengthwise of the street,
rode facing the sidewalk on the left. In order to see
them, Ben Ali was obliged to keep Rajah somewhat out
of the line.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with Ben Ali?" asked McGlory,
leaning forward and talking in front of Haidee. "He's
showing a heap more interest in the <i>Comet</i> than he ever
did before."</p>

<p>Matt shook his head, and met steadily the piercing
eyes of the Hindoo until they were turned forward
again.</p>

<p>"What is your uncle looking this way for, Haidee?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>The girl expressed herself in the same mechanical
way she had done before.</p>

<p>"Haidee isn't herself," said Matt, "and I guess her
uncle is worried. Change seats with her, Joe."</p>

<p>Matt wanted to talk with his cowboy chum and did
not want to be under the necessity of passing his words
around the girl.</p>

<p>"Move over, sis," requested McGlory, standing up and
balancing himself on the foot-rest.</p>

<p>The girl quietly slipped along the plane.</p>

<p>Cheer after cheer greeted the aëroplane and the king
of the motor boys as soon as the crowded thoroughfares
were reached. Ping, on the upper wing, and clad
in all his barbaric finery, was as proud as a peacock.
Haidee, on the other hand, paid absolutely no attention
to the crowds. She sat rigidly in her place, like a girl
carved from stone, keeping her unblinking eyes straight
ahead of her.</p>

<p>"I'm plumb beat, and no mistake," breathed McGlory,
in Matt's ear. "I never saw Haidee like this before.
She acts to me like she was locoed."</p>

<p>"Boss Burton told me, just before we started," answered
Matt, in a low tone, "that she was subject to
'spells.' This is the first one she has had in a month,
Burton says."</p>

<p>"Can you savvy it?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Ben Ali seems worried out of his wits. Watch how
he keeps Rajah zigzagging back and forth across the
trail, so he can get a look at the girl every now and
then. I wonder if Haidee knows what she's about?"</p>

<p>"She must. If she didn't she wouldn't be riding in
the aëroplane."</p>

<p>The bands played, the crowds waved hands and handkerchiefs
and cheered, the clowns carried out all their
funny stunts, and the procession moved on through the
city of Lafayette. Students from Purdue University
followed the paraders and blew long blasts through tin
horns. Rajah showed signs of becoming restless, and
Ben Ali's attention had to be given entirely to the big
brute.</p>

<p>Matt, with one hand on the steering lever, kept the
unwieldy machine moving in a straight track.</p>

<p>"What do you suppose Ben Ali was listening to Carl's
talk for, there on the inside of the menagerie tent?"
inquired the cowboy, his voice so low it could not possibly
reach Haidee. "I had a notion that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sh-h-h!" Matt interrupted. "I had the same notion,
Joe, but it was only a wild guess, at the most. He's
a prying chap, that Ben Ali, and he might have had
only a casual interest in what Carl was saying."</p>

<p>"I'll bet a ten-dollar bill against a chink wash ticket
that there was something more to it than that."</p>

<p>"Well, if there was, it's bound to come out, sooner
or later. Say nothing, but keep your eyes open."</p>

<p>"I've always felt that there was a mystery about the
girl and Ben Ali, and that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>McGlory broke off suddenly. Haidee, with the quickness
of lightning, had leaned over behind him and jerked
one of the levers at Matt's side.</p>

<p>The next instant the big aëroplane took a wild jump
forward. The king of the motor boys was alive to the
danger in an instant.</p>

<p>"Hold the girl!" he cried, and instantly flung the lever
back.</p>

<p>The front ends of the two great wings had hurled
themselves against Rajah. The huge animal trumpeted
wildly and swung about on his hind legs with trunk
uplifted.</p>

<p>It seemed as though he would surely charge the <i>Comet</i>,
wreck the machine, and kill or maim the four who were
riding in it.</p>

<p>McGlory, with Haidee in his arms, leaped from the
foot-rest into the road. Ping rolled off the opposite side
of the upper plane.</p>

<p>Had Matt deserted his post, the <i>Comet</i> would certainly
have been seriously damaged, if not totally
wrecked. But, in spite of the danger that threatened
him, he kept his seat.</p>

<p>Quick as a flash, he threw in the reverse. The bulky
machine began wabbling away on the back track, the
clown in the donkey cart behind, and the acrobatic "haymakers"
in their trick wagon, driving frantically out of
the way.</p>

<p>Ben Ali was using his sharp prod with apparent
frenzy, but the jabbing point had not the least effect.
Rajah started for Matt and the <i>Comet</i>.</p>

<p>Then, had not Delhi's mahout been self-possessed and
quick, the worst would have happened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>People in the street jumped for the walk, and those
on the walk pushing into the open doors of shops.
Shrieks and cries went up from the women, and men
yelled in consternation.</p>

<p>Across Rajah's path, with a rush, charged Delhi,
coming to a halt and blocking the way. Rajah tried
to go around, but Delhi backed and continued to cut
off his retreat.</p>

<p>By that time Boss Burton had whirled to the scene
in the runabout, and half a dozen men, from the forward
wagons, were all around Rajah, belaboring the brute
with cudgels, whips, and whatever they could get their
hands on.</p>

<p>Rajah's incipient rage was soon quelled by this heroic
treatment.</p>

<p>"What happened?" demanded Burton, drawing up beside
the aëroplane.</p>

<p>"The machine made a jump," answered Matt, not
wishing to put the blame on the girl. "Rajah was too
close. Tell Ben Ali to pay more attention to the elephant
and less to us, and to keep in the centre of the
road."</p>

<p>Burton was angry. The fault seemed to lie with Matt,
but Ben Ali caught the brunt of the showman's ire.</p>

<p>Ping, his yellow face like a piece of old cheese, got
back on the upper wing, and McGlory led Haidee to the
<i>Comet</i> and helped her to her seat.</p>

<p>"Speak to me about that!" gulped the cowboy. "I'm
a Piegan if I didn't think you and the old <i>Comet</i> were
done for. What possessed the girl?"</p>

<p>"Give it up," answered Matt grimly. "As you said
a while ago, pard, these are queer proceedings. Just
watch Haidee every minute."</p>

<p>"She didn't know what she was doing, and you can
gamble a blue stack on that."</p>

<p>"Of course she didn't. That's why I didn't tell Burton
the real cause of the trouble. Keep it to yourself,
Joe."</p>

<p class="chaptitle">MOTOR MATT PROTESTS.</p>


<p>The parade was finished without further incident worthy
of note, a huge crowd following it back to the show
grounds to see the aëroplane flight. As soon as the
grounds were reached, Ben Ali came for Haidee. There
was a burning light in his black eyes, and he was shaking
like a man with the ague.</p>

<p>"Just a minute, Ben Ali," said Matt, catching the
Hindoo by the sleeve of his embroidered coat and leading
him apart. "What's the matter with your niece?"</p>

<p>"Salaam, sahib," chattered Ben Ali. "Haidee all
right soon."</p>

<p>"She can't make an ascension with me, Ben Ali. She
was the cause of that trouble, and it would be sheer
madness to take her aloft on that trapeze."</p>

<p>"Yis, sahib, <i>such baht</i>" (that is true). Ben Ali drew
a quivering hand over his forehead. "But she be well
like ever soon, sahib."</p>

<p>Ben Ali whirled away, took Haidee by the hand, and
vanished among the wagons.</p>

<p>Boss Burton strode to the scene.</p>

<p>"What ails that brown rascal?" he asked, staring after
Ben Ali. "He's in as bad a taking as the girl. What
did he say about her? I've never been able to get him
to tell me anything about her spells."</p>

<p>"He tells me that she will be all right in a little
while," answered Matt.</p>

<p>"Then we'll delay the flight. It will be half an hour
yet before all the people get here."</p>

<p>Matt peered at the showman as though he thought him
out of his senses.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say that you want the girl to
ride a trapeze under the <i>Comet</i>?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Why not?" Burton answered. "You said you'd take
her, and she's willing to go&mdash;she wants to go."</p>

<p>"When I said I'd take her," returned Matt, "I didn't
know anything about her spells. Suppose she were to
have one while we're in the air? Why, Burton, she
might throw herself from the trapeze."</p>

<p>"No," declared the other, "she wouldn't do that. After
she has one spell, I understand she doesn't have another
for days, or weeks. It's been a month since she had the
last. Why, in St. Paul, she had one ten minutes before
she went to the ring for her trapeze work&mdash;and she
never did better. If Ben Ali says she'll be all right in
a little while he ought to know."</p>

<p>"I protest against allowing her to go up in the aëroplane,"
said Matt firmly. "When the machine is off the
ground it has to have my whole attention. I won't be
able to look after Haidee without endangering both our
lives."</p>

<p>A hard look came into Burton's face.</p>

<p>"I'm paying you five hundred a week for the stunt
you pull off with the flying machine, ain't I?" he demanded
harshly.</p>

<p>"You are," was the young motorist's calm response.</p>

<p>"And I'm giving the fifty on top of that for taking
the girl up with you?"</p>

<p>"That was your proposition."</p>

<p>"And you agreed to it?"</p>

<p>"That was before I knew Haidee was afflicted in this
way, Burton."</p>

<p>"Bosh!" scoffed the showman. "The thing has got on
your nerves."</p>

<p>"So it has," acknowledged Matt. "I'm not going to
place Haidee in any danger, if I can help it."</p>

<p>"And that shot goes as it lays, Burton," spoke up
McGlory, who had been taking a deep interest in the
talk. "If you think Motor Matt is going to risk the
girl's neck, or his own, for a little fifty a week, you've
got another guess coming."</p>

<p>Boss Burton had set his heart on that trapeze act.
It was a decided novelty, and he could not cut it out of
his calculations.</p>

<p>"Am I to understand," he went on, taking a look at the
gathering crowds, "that you'll break your contract rather
than take Haidee up with you?"</p>

<p>"That's what you're to understand!" snapped McGlory.
"We'll not hem, and haw, and side-step, not for a holy
minute."</p>

<p>"It's this way, Burton," continued Matt. "Haidee
can't go up on the trapeze&mdash;we have to take a running
start, you know, and it would be impossible. She'll have
to ride up on the lower plane; then, after we are well
clear of the ground, she'll have to drop from the footboard
with the trapeze in her hands. If she's not entirely
herself, the drop from the footboard to the end of
the trapeze ropes will be too much for her. She'll
fall."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I told you that after she comes out of these
things she's as fit as ever," cried Burton. "It's a still
day&mdash;the best we've had for flying since you joined the
show. I don't want to give up the idea."</p>

<p>"And you don't want to see Haidee killed before your
eyes, do you?" asked Matt coldly.</p>

<p>"Oh, splash! There'll be nothing of that kind. Ah,
look! Here she comes, and she's just as well as ever."</p>

<p>Matt and McGlory turned. Haidee, ready for the ascent,
was hurrying toward the machine from the direction
of the tent. She moved swiftly and gracefully, and
there was nothing mechanical in her actions&mdash;as there
had been during the parade. The pallor had left her
cheeks and the vacant look was gone from her eyes.
Matt and McGlory were astounded at the sudden change
in her.</p>

<p>"Are you all ready for me, Motor Matt?" she asked
eagerly.</p>

<p>The trapeze was ready. That had been attached to the
under plane of the <i>Comet</i> and the bar lashed to the foot-rest
before the parade. But Matt was not ready.</p>

<p>"How are you feeling, Haidee?" asked Matt kindly.</p>

<p>"Fine!" she declared.</p>

<p>"Do you remember what happened during the parade?"</p>

<p>A puzzled look crossed her face.</p>

<p>"I can't remember a thing about that," she declared.
"In fact, everything has been a blank almost from the
time I left the calliope tent, where I was talking with
you, until I came to myself in the menagerie tent with
Uncle Ben."</p>

<p>Matt bowed his head thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked the girl, in a quivering
voice. "Aren't you going to take me up with the
<i>Comet</i>?"</p>

<p>"He's afraid you'll have a spell while you're in the
air, Haidee, and drop off the bar," jeered Burton.</p>

<p>The girl stepped forward and caught Matt's sleeve.</p>

<p>"Oh, it can't be true!" she exclaimed tearfully. "Motor
Matt, you're not going to keep me from making that
extra money? I need it! I must have it!"</p>

<p>The girl's earnestness made Matt waver.</p>

<p>"It won't do," spoke up McGlory decidedly.</p>

<p>"Joe!" and Haidee turned on him. "Why can't you
understand that I'm just as able as ever to do my
trapeze work? I'll not have another of those queer
spells for a long time."</p>

<p>"That's what you think, sis," answered McGlory, "but
if anything happened to you my pard would remember it
as long as he lived. He has just protested to Burton
against taking you up. And he had a bean on the right
number when he said what he did."</p>

<p>"<i>I'm</i> taking the chances," said Haidee, "and nothing
will happen."</p>

<p>The aëroplane was at rest on the hard roadway running
across the show grounds. For a distance of twenty
feet on each side of the road strong ropes were stretched
to keep back the crowd. The throng was now pressing
against the ropes, clamoring for the aëroplane to make its
flight.</p>

<p>"If this performance don't come off," said Boss Burton,
"it will be a tough blow for the Big Consolidated.
I advertised this trapeze stunt on the flying machine in
the morning papers, wiring it ahead from Indianapolis.
It's <i>got</i> to be done, that's all. Every promise made in
our bills is always carried out. That's what has given
this show a hold with the people. I don't say one thing
and then do another."</p>

<p>"Circumstances alter cases," returned Matt.</p>

<p>"If you don't want to take Haidee, will you take
Archie le Bon?"</p>

<p>Archie le Bon was one of the Le Bon Brothers, iron-nerved
men who performed wonderful flying feats on the
trapeze.</p>

<p>"Certainly I'll take Archie le Bon," replied Matt, glad
to find such a way out of the disagreement. "Bring
him here while I'm getting the machine ready."</p>

<p>Haidee began to cry, but Burton took her by the arm
and led her away, talking earnestly and in a low voice.</p>

<p>A trick was worked on the king of the motor boys
that morning, and it was something for which he never
forgave Boss Burton. And it was a trick carried to a
successful conclusion almost under the very eyes of McGlory
and Ping. Matt, being busy with the aëroplane
and the motor, did not discover it until too late.</p>

<p>Matt went over the machinery of the <i>Comet</i> with the
same care he exercised before every flight. A loose bolt
or screw might spell death for him if it escaped his
attention.</p>

<p>When he was through with his examination, and had
taken his seat ready for the flight. Le Bon appeared.
He was in his shirt sleeves, not having had time to
exchange his everyday clothes for ring costume.</p>

<p>"I'll run with the machine," said Le Bon, "and climb
over the lower plane from behind when it gets to running
too fast for me."</p>

<p>"That will do," answered Matt.</p>

<p>Amid the breathless silence of the crowd, Matt set the
motor to working.</p>

<p>"Ready!" he called.</p>

<p>The machine started along the road, gaining in speed
with every foot of its progress.</p>

<p>At the end of fifty feet it was going faster than a
man could run; and at a hundred feet it was darting
along at thirty miles an hour. This was the gait that
enabled the wing to pick the machine off the ground.</p>

<p>As the <i>Comet</i> slid upward along its airy path, the
astounded McGlory saw Le Bon far back toward the
point from which the machine had started. Thinking
that, through some mistake, Le Bon had been left behind,
McGlory turned toward the mounting aëroplane.</p>

<p>Then the trick dawned upon him.</p>

<p>Haidee was climbing over the lower plane toward
Motor Matt, now and again turning to wave her hand
at the cheering crowd!</p>

<p>And McGlory saw something else&mdash;something that had
a fearful significance in the light of later events.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">ABLAZE IN THE AIR.</p>


<p>When the king of the motor boys was in the air with
the <i>Comet</i>, every power of mind and body was trained
to the work of looking after the machine.</p>

<p>Flying in an aëroplane is vastly more difficult than
sailing in a balloon. In the case of a gas bag, an
aëronaut has only to throw out ballast, take his ease,
and trust to luck; but, with a heavier-than-air machine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
the aviator must rely upon the quickness of his wits and
his dexterity.</p>

<p>Aëroplane flying, in a large measure, is a knack, and
must be acquired. The air pressure never touches the
machine in exactly the same point for two consecutive
seconds, and, because of this, the centre of gravity is
constantly changing. Centre of gravity and centre of
air pressure must coincide at all times if the machine is to
be kept in the air, and the success or failure to do this
proves the competency or the incompetency of the operator.</p>

<p>The Traquair aëroplane&mdash;upon which model Matt's
machine had been built&mdash;preserved its equilibrium while
aloft by an elongation, or contraction, of the wing tips.
A lever regulated this; and, whenever Matt was flying,
the lever was moving continuously, the ends of the
wings darting out and in with lightning-like rapidity, one
side presenting greater wing area to the pressure while
the other presented less, and vice versa.</p>

<p>Motor Matt's engagement with Boss Burton did not
cover long flights. Usually, if the weather was propitious,
he made it a point to remain aloft about fifteen minutes,
circling about the show grounds, turning sharp corners
and cutting airy "figure eights," in order to show the
capabilities of the aëroplane.</p>

<p>"Get your trapeze over, Le Bon!" he called, while
they were steadily mounting.</p>

<p>A laugh was his answer&mdash;a silvery ripple of a laugh
that had a familiar ring in his ears and now filled him
with consternation. He dared not look around.</p>

<p>"Haidee!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Are you mad at me, Motor Matt?" came the voice
of the girl.</p>

<p>She cautiously slipped into the seat beside him, her
heightened color and sparkling eyes showing her excitement.</p>

<p>"This was a trick," went on Matt calmly, attending
to his work with an indifference more apparent than
real, "which you and Le Bon and Burton played on
me?"</p>

<p>"It was Burton's idea, and he told it to me while we
were going after Archie le Bon. Archie was to pretend
to run with the machine, and I was to be with him.
When the machine got to going too fast for us, Archie
was to drop to one side and I was to spring to the
lower wing. Your back would be in my direction, and
you couldn't see me."</p>

<p>"That wasn't like you, Haidee," said Matt.</p>

<p>"Are you mad?"</p>

<p>"What's the use of being put out with you? I'll
have something to say to Burton and Le Bon when I
get back to the grounds."</p>

<p>"You thought you were doing something to help me&mdash;I
know that&mdash;but you didn't understand I was perfectly
able to carry out my part of the programme. As it is now,
I came along and you couldn't help yourself. Are you
going to try and keep me from dropping under the machine
with the trapeze?"</p>

<p>"No," was the grim reply, "now that you are here you
can go on with your work. Hold to the hand grip on
the edge of the plane while you unlash the bar."</p>

<p>Perfectly cool, and in complete command of her
nerves, Haidee knelt on the foot-rest, clinging to the
plane with one hand while she unlashed the trapeze bar
with the other.</p>

<p>"I'm ready, Motor Matt," said Haidee.</p>

<p>She was sitting on the edge of the seat, holding the
bar in both hands.</p>

<p>Matt had brought the <i>Comet</i> to an even keel, some
fifty feet over the show grounds. They were traveling
about thirty miles an hour&mdash;a snail's pace for the <i>Comet</i>&mdash;and
Matt was about to make a turn over the river and
traverse the length of the grounds going the other way.</p>

<p>"Now, listen," said he to the girl. "I'm going to tilt
the <i>Comet</i> sharply upward and ascend for about fifty
feet, then I'm going to reverse the position and descend
for fifty feet in the same sharp angle. When we turn
for the descent, Haidee, drop from the foot-rest when
I give the word. The pull of your body, when it falls,
will drag on the machine, but never mind that&mdash;hang
on and don't get scared. As soon as I can I will bring
the machine to a level. Understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And another thing. While you're moving on the bar,
just remember to do it quietly and easily. You've seen
the two Japs at work in the show, I know. When the
big fellow balances the pole on his shoulder, and the
little fellow goes up, every move is made as though
there would be a smash if they were not careful."</p>

<p>"I understand," said the girl.</p>

<p>The machine had been brought around and was heading
toward the grounds. Matt twisted the small forward
planes, which laid the course for ascending or descending.
At the same time he speeded up the motor.</p>

<p>The <i>Comet</i> pointed upward; then, at the top of her
course, was as quickly turned and aimed toward the
earth.</p>

<p>Matt caught a glimpse of a sea of upturned faces.
The machine was rushing downward at a frightful pace.</p>

<p>"<i>Now!</i>" shouted Matt.</p>

<p>He saw the girl poise birdlike on the foot-rest, then
sink from it with the trapeze. So great was the slant
of the aëroplane that she seemed to fall forward.</p>

<p>There was a jar as the bar reached the end of the
ropes, and, with the girl's weight, was caught and held.
The <i>Comet</i> made an erratic wabble and lurched sideways
like a great bird, wounded on the wing.</p>

<p>Haidee withstood the jolt admirably, and Matt twirled
the lever operating the steering planes.</p>

<p>Sounds from the earth always reach aëronauts with
startling distinctness. The shouts of consternation which
came from the throats of the spectators could be heard,
and also the murmur of relief as the <i>Comet</i> righted herself,
and the trapeze and the girl swung back under the
machine.</p>

<p>Controlling the aëroplane was always more difficult
when there was a weight suspended beneath, but Matt
had counted upon this, and he forced the <i>Comet</i> back
and forth over the show grounds, holding the machine
fairly steady.</p>

<p>Three times he and Haidee circled over the "tops"
with their gay streamers, cheer upon cheer following
them from below.</p>

<p>Matt had been in the air more than fifteen minutes,
and he was just man&oelig;uvring toward the starting and
stopping point, when the cheers were suddenly turned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
cries of fear and alarm. He could see the people below
waving their arms and pointing upward.</p>

<p>For an instant the young motorist's heart sank. He
felt sure that something had gone wrong with the girl.</p>

<p>This conviction had hardly formed before it was dissipated.
A smell of smoke came to his nostrils, and to
his ears a crackle of flames. Matt turned his head.</p>

<p>The left wing of the aëroplane was on fire!</p>

<p>A thrill of horror shot through him. In the air, he
and Haidee, with a blazing flying machine alone between
them and death! The very thought was enough to
wrench the stoutest nerves.</p>

<p>"Haidee!" yelled Matt.</p>

<p>"Yes," came the stifled response, from underneath the
<i>Comet</i>.</p>

<p>"Are you all right?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Hang to the bar&mdash;don't lose your nerve!"</p>

<p>Matt's mind was grappling with the complex situation.
To get safely to the ground in the shortest possible time
was the problem that confronted him.</p>

<p>How the wing had caught fire he did not know, and
had not the time even to guess. It sufficed that the plane
was ablaze, and that the longer it blazed and ate into the
fabric the less resistance the plane made to the atmosphere.
And it was this resistance that spelled life for
the king of the motor boys and the girl!</p>

<p>To drop the blazing aëroplane into that sea of heads
below meant injury to some of the spectators. Matt
must avoid this and reach the earth in the roped-off
lane from which the ascent had been made.</p>

<p>He put the clamps on his nerves, and, with brain perfectly
clear, drove the aëroplane about at a sharp angle.</p>

<p>Then, if ever, the machine was true to its name, for
as it darted onward, the smoke and flame that streamed
out behind must have given it the look of a comet.</p>

<p>Could he drop to earth, the young motorist was asking
himself, before the fire struck either of the gasoline
tanks?</p>

<p>Motor Matt, as he coaxed the last ounce of speed
from the motor, shouted encouragingly to the terrified
girl on the trapeze.</p>

<p>Suddenly, below him opened the narrow lane roped
off along the road. A buzz of excited voices echoed in
his ears. With steady hand he shut off the power and
glided downward.</p>

<p>"Drop from the bar and run, Haidee," he shouted,
"as soon as we come close to the ground."</p>

<p>There was a response from the girl, but the clamor
of the crowd prevented him from hearing what it was.</p>

<p>The next moment the blazing aëroplane settled into
the road and glided along on the bicycle wheels.</p>

<p>McGlory, Carl, and Ping were on hand, the cowboy in
charge of a detachment of canvasmen with buckets. A
hiss of steam, as water struck the flames, rose in the air.</p>

<p>"Careful!" cried Matt, restraining the impetuous assault
of the fire fighters. "Don't climb over the machine
and damage it! Keep them back, Joe! Here, some of
you, drench the wings on the right side and keep the
fire from spreading."</p>

<p>Ably directed by Matt and McGlory, the fire was extinguished.
Leaving the damaged aëroplane in charge
of Carl and Ping, Matt limped off toward the calliope
tent, accompanied by his cowboy chum.</p>




<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">WAS IT TREACHERY?</p>


<p>"Where's Haidee?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"Oh, bother the girl!" cried McGlory savagely.</p>

<p>Matt turned on him with a surprised look.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you, pard?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Well, it's apples to ashes that I was never so badly
shaken up in my life before as I am this minute. Sufferin'
Judas! Say, I'd never have believed it."</p>

<p>The crowd was dense. Some of the people were moving
off toward the city, some were making for the side-show,
and others were trying to get close to the king of
the motor boys. Matt, having just finished a sensational
flight, was an object of curiosity and admiration.</p>

<p>Neither he nor McGlory paid any attention to the
demonstration around them, but moved briskly onward
toward the calliope tent.</p>

<p>"I can't rise to you, Joe," said the puzzled Matt.
"What's on your mind?"</p>

<p>"Something more'n my hat, and you can bet your moccasins
on that."</p>

<p>"Where did Haidee go?"</p>

<p>"That leather-faced tinhorn uncle of hers grabbed her
and took her away the minute she dropped from the
trapeze."</p>

<p>"She wasn't hurt, was she?"</p>

<p>"I didn't take any trouble to find out. She walked off
spry enough."</p>

<p>McGlory was gruff to the point of incivility. It was
evident to Matt that he had been mightily stirred.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you?" demanded Matt.</p>

<p>"Wait till we get into the calliope tent, and out of
this crowd and the dust&mdash;then I'll tell you."</p>

<p>"Didn't you discover the trick Boss Burton played on
me with the help of Haidee and Le Bon, Joe?"</p>

<p>"Oh, speak to me about that!" snarled the cowboy.
"Nary, I didn't, pard, until it was too everlastin'ly late
to stop the run of the cards. Burton! We've got a bone
to pick with him; and, after it's picked, I feel like cramming
it down his throat. He was bound to have the girl
go up, and he worked it in his sneaking, underhand
way! I don't like this layout, Matt. You've had the
closest call that's ever come your way since you took to
flying. Sufferin' cats! Say, my heart was in my throat
all the while I was looking on. I was expecting that
any minute the fire would reach the gasoline, that both
tanks would let go, and that you, and the girl, and the
<i>Comet</i> would all be wiped out in a big noise and a
splotch of flame."</p>

<p>By this time they had reached the calliope tent, and
were able to duck inside and get away from the crowd.</p>

<p>The calliope was there, and filling the larger part of
the interior. The big steam organ was shrouded in a
canvas cover, and only the lower rims of the wagon
wheels on which it was mounted were to be seen.</p>

<p>Matt dropped down on a heap of straw and leaned
back wearily against a side pole. McGlory threw himself
down beside him, his face thoughtful and angry.</p>

<p>"I hadn't any notion Burton was running in a rhinecaboo,"
said the cowboy presently, "until the <i>Comet</i> had
jumped into the air and I had looked back and seen Le
Bon near the place from which the machine had started.
When I turned and looked at you and the <i>Comet</i>, there
was the Haidee girl perched on the lower wing, throwin'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
kisses to the crowd. I knew then that Burton had turned
his trick, and I lammed loose a yell; but there was too
much noise for you to hear it. I kept my eyes on the
aëroplane and the girl and&mdash;and I saw something then
that made my hair curl later when the fire broke out."</p>

<p>"What was it?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"Haidee, pushing something out on the left-hand wing
and jabbing it down there with a hatpin, so it would
stay."</p>

<p>"We must have been three or four hundred feet away
from you, Joe," returned Matt, "and how could you see
it was a hatpin?"</p>

<p>McGlory sat up, opened the front of his coat, and
drew a blistered hatpin out of the lining.</p>

<p>"I hunted around under the machine, while we were
fighting the fire," he explained, "and picked up that.
So, you see, I know it was a hatpin."</p>

<p>A frown crossed Matt's face.</p>

<p>"What do you make out of that move of Haidee's?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"She pinned a ball of something soaked in oil to the
wing and touched it off," averred McGlory. "It smouldered
for a while and then blazed up and set fire to the
canvas."</p>

<p>"Joe," returned Matt incredulously, "you must be mistaken.
I've always been a friend of Haidee's. Why
should she want to destroy the <i>Comet</i>, or me? When
you come to that, why should she want to take her own
life? That's virtually what it would have amounted to
if the fire had reached the gasoline tanks."</p>

<p>"Who could have started the fire, if it wasn't the girl?"
demanded McGlory. "She was the one."</p>

<p>Matt was nonplused. His cowboy chum seemed to
have drawn a correct inference, but the supposition was
so preposterous the king of the motor boys could take
no stock in it.</p>

<p>"We've got to use a little common sense, Joe," insisted
Matt. "The girl wouldn't have the least motive in the
world for trying to do such a thing as set fire to the
<i>Comet</i>!"</p>

<p>"We've got to bank on what we see," answered McGlory,
"no matter whether we want to believe our eyes
or not. Look at it! Haidee comes to the aëroplane for
the parade like a wooden figure of a girl, moving like a
puppet worked by strings. Suddenly she flashes out of
her locoed condition and pulls a lever that slams the
<i>Comet</i> against Rajah's heels. Well, we protected the girl
from that because we believed she was having one of her
'spells.' She came out of the spell all of a sudden and
lopes down to where the aëroplane stands ready for the
start. She seems as well as ever, and begs to go up on
the trapeze. A trick is played on us, and she <i>does</i> go up.
Then, once more, she gets the <i>Comet</i> into trouble. I
can't savvy the blooming layout, but I'm keen to know
that some one is starting in to do us up. And Haidee
is one of our enemies."</p>

<p>Just then Boss Burton pushed into the tent. He was
nervous and cast furtive glances at Motor Matt.</p>

<p>"Great business!" he exclaimed. "Le Bon got juggled
out of the ascension, after all, and Haidee, the sly minx!
did her stunt on the trapeze, just as she had planned.
How in the world did the machine take fire? Crossed
wires, or something?"</p>

<p>"You need not try to dodge responsibility, Burton,"
said Matt sharply. "You put up the trick that was
played on me."</p>

<p>"On my honor, King&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't talk that way," interrupted Matt. "Come out
flat-footed and admit it."</p>

<p>"Well," grinned Burton, a little sheepishly, "if you put
it that way, I'll have to acknowledge the corn. But the
girl was clear-headed, wasn't she? She didn't fall off
the trapeze, and she pulled off some hair-raising tricks
on that flying bar that set the crowd gasping. It was the
biggest novelty in the way of an act that any show ever
put up. Results will show at the ticket wagon this afternoon.
Too confoundedly bad, though, that the thing
should have been marred by that fire. How long will it
take you to fix up the machine? Can you do it in time
for an ascent to-night? I've planned to have Haidee
shoot off skyrockets from the trapeze, and Roman
candles, and all that."</p>

<p>"You'll have to cut out the fireworks, Burton," said
Matt dryly. "It will take a full day to repair the <i>Comet</i>."</p>

<p>Burton "went up in the air" on the instant.</p>

<p>"Think of the loss!" he exclaimed. "You've got to repair
the machine in time for the ascent this evening. If
it's a matter of men, King, I'll give you a dozen to help."</p>

<p>"It's not a matter of men," said Matt. "Joe and I are
the only ones who can work on the <i>Comet</i>. And listen to
this&mdash;I mean it, and if you don't like it we'll break our
contract right here&mdash;Haidee has gone up with me for
the last time. I'll take Archie le Bon, or any one else
you want to send, but not Haidee."</p>

<p>"Is this what you call treating me square?" fumed
Burton.</p>

<p>"Sufferin' Ananias!" grunted McGlory. "You're a
nice lame duck to talk about being treated square! You've
got a treacherous outfit, Burton, and Pard Matt and I
are not beginning to like it any too well."</p>

<p>Matt, thinking McGlory might tell what Haidee had
done, gave him a restraining look.</p>

<p>"You're responsible for the trouble that overtook the
<i>Comet</i>, Burton," proceeded Matt.</p>

<p>"Me?" echoed the showman, aghast. "Well, I'd like
to know how you figure it."</p>

<p>"Through your schemes, and over my protest, Haidee
made the ascent with me."</p>

<p>"I'll admit that."</p>

<p>"If she hadn't made the ascent, there'd have been no
fire."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now, don't jump at any conclusions. I know what
I'm talking about when I tell you that there'd have been
no fire if Haidee hadn't made the ascent with me. That
isn't saying, mark you, that the girl is to blame for what
happened. Would she want to burn the aëroplane and
drop herself and me plump into the show grounds?
If&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Just then a weird thing happened. The calliope gave
a sharp clatter of high notes.</p>

<p>All present in the tent gave astounded attention to the
canvas-covered music box.</p>

<p>"Spooks!" grinned Joe.</p>

<p>"There was enough steam left in the calliope to play a
few notes," suggested Burton.</p>

<p>"But the notes couldn't play themselves," said Matt,
and made a rush for the calliope.</p>

<p>The keyboard was in one end of the calliope wagon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
and the canvas was draped over the chair occupied by
the operator when the steam wagon was in use.</p>

<p>With a pull, Matt jerked aside the canvas that covered
the rear of the calliope, and there, crouching in a chair,
was Ben Ali!</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A CALL FOR HELP.</p>


<p>"Well, sizzlin' thunderbolts!" gasped the amazed
Burton.</p>

<p>At first, Ben Ali sat blinking at those before him, apparently
too dazed to move.</p>

<p>"He's an eavesdropper!" cried McGlory, "and this
ain't the first time we've caught him at it, either. Grab
him, Matt! Wring that thin neck of his!"</p>

<p>Ben Ali regained his wits, then, and very suddenly.
With a panther-like spring, he cleared the wagon on the
side opposite that where Motor Matt was standing,
dodged McGlory, who tried to head him off, shook a
glittering knife in Boss Burton's face, and vanished under
the wall of the menagerie tent. It was all so neatly
done that the three in the calliope lean-to were left
staring at each other in helpless astonishment.</p>

<p>McGlory rushed furiously at the menagerie tent wall,
lifted the canvas, then dropped it and rushed back.</p>

<p>"Not for me!" he breathed. "Rajah is right there,
teetering back and forth from side to side, and winding
his trunk around everything in sight."</p>

<p>"Where was Ben Ali?" demanded Burton, a glitter
rising in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Getting out under the cages on the other side of the
tent," replied McGlory. "I'll see if I can't head him
off."</p>

<p>With that the cowboy shot out of the lean-to. Matt
didn't think the effort to catch Ben Ali worth while,
and once more dropped down on the pile of straw.</p>

<p>For a few moments Boss Burton walked back and
forth in front of him, hands behind his back, head bowed
in thought, and a black frown on his face. Abruptly he
halted in front of Matt.</p>

<p>"The infernal Hindoo drew a knife on me!" he
scowled.</p>

<p>Matt nodded. The fact had been too plain to call for
comment.</p>

<p>"I'd pull the pin on Ben Ali in half a minute," continued
Boss Burton, "if it wasn't for Haidee."</p>

<p>"Where did you pick up Ben Ali and Haidee?" inquired
Matt.</p>

<p>"In Wisconsin," was the answer, "just as the show
was starting out of its winter quarters. Rajah had run
amuck, wounded a horse, smashed a wagon, and come
within an ace of killing his keeper. Ben Ali applied
for the job of looking after him, and I let him have it.
He's been the only one, so far, who could take care of
Rajah."</p>

<p>"Where did the girl come in?"</p>

<p>"She came in with her uncle, of course. Ben Ali said
his niece was good on the flying bar, and he brought
her to see me. When she came she was in one of her
spells, and looked and acted like a puppet, with some one
pulling the wires. I wasn't much impressed with her,
but gave her a try-out. She recovered from the spell
and acted just as she did to-day, when she went up with
the <i>Comet</i>&mdash;perfectly natural. She gave a good performance&mdash;mighty
good&mdash;and I made a deal with her
uncle. That's the way I got tangled up with the pair.
Why?"</p>

<p>The showman transfixed Matt with a curious glance.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing," said Matt carelessly. "The Hindoo
and the girl have always been something of a mystery
to me, and I wanted to find out what you knew about
them. Where did they come from?"</p>

<p>"Give it up. I never look into the past of people
who hire out to me. If they're capable, and do their
work, that's enough. From what McGlory said, and
from what I've seen, Ben Ali appears to have been
sneaking around here, listening to what you and your
friends were saying. If he hadn't inadvertently touched
the keyboard of the calliope we shouldn't have known
he was under the cover. Have you any notion what he
means by that sort of work?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Well, it's deuced queer, and that's all I can say. Do
you think he ought to be bounced?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I wouldn't do it."</p>

<p>"On Haidee's account?"</p>

<p>"Partly that; partly, too, because, if you keep him on
the pay roll, we may be able to learn something about
him and the girl. I'm a bit curious about them, Burton."</p>

<p>"It's a bad habit&mdash;this of getting too curious. It's
dollars and cents for me to have the two with the show.
What's more," and his remarks took a more personal
turn, "it's money in my pocket to have the <i>Comet</i> go
up this afternoon with Haidee shooting Roman candles
from the trapeze. When are you going to get busy with
the repairs?"</p>

<p>"After I eat something."</p>

<p>"Well, rush the work, Matt. Do the best you can."</p>

<p>"It won't be Haidee who rides the trapeze next time
the <i>Comet</i> takes to the air," said the king of the motor
boys firmly.</p>

<p>"Well, Archie le Bon, then," returned Burton, with
much disappointment.</p>

<p>As he went out, McGlory came in, passing him in the
entrance.</p>

<p>"Nothing doing," reported the cowboy. "Where the
Hindoo went is a conundrum. I couldn't find anybody
about the grounds who had even seen him since he
walked Haidee away from the burning aëroplane."</p>

<p>While McGlory, disgusted with his ill success and the
turn events were taking, there on the banks of the
Wabash, slumped down on a bucket and mopped his
perspiring face, Motor Matt dropped into a brown
study.</p>

<p>"These Hindoos are crafty fellows, Joe," he remarked,
after a while. "They're clever at a great many things
we Americans don't understand anything about. I knew
one of them once. He was the servant of a man who
happened to be the uncle of one of the finest young fellows
that ever stepped&mdash;brave Dick Ferral. This particular
Hindoo I was able to study at close range."</p>

<p>"What are you leading up to by this sort of talk?"
asked McGlory, cocking his head on one side and squinting
his eyes.</p>

<p>He had this habit when anything puzzled him.</p>

<p>"I'm leading up to the element of mystery that hangs
over the events of to-day. India is a land of mystery.
The people are a dreamy set, and now and then one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
them will go off into the woods, or the desert, and spend
several years as a devotee. When he comes back to
civilization again he's able to do wonderful things. I've
heard that these fakirs can throw a rope into the air
and that it will hang there; and that they can make a
boy climb the rope, up, and up, until he disappears.
Then rope, boy, and all but the fakir will vanish."</p>

<p>"Fakes," grunted Joe. "Such things ain't in reason,
pard. You know what a fakir is in this country, and
I reckon he's not much better in India."</p>

<p>"Of course it's a fake," said Matt, "but it's a pretty
smooth piece of magic. The Hindoo devotees could give
Hermann and all the other magicians cards and spades
and then beat them out."</p>

<p>"I'm blamed if I can see yet where all this talk of
yours leads to."</p>

<p>"I'm only, what you might call, thinking out loud,"
laughed Matt. "Haidee's actions puzzle me. Her uncle
is a Hindoo, and he may be an adept in magic. If he
is, just how much has the girl's queer actions to do
with Ben Ali? It's something to think about. I'm glad
Burton isn't going to cut loose from the Hindoo and the
girl. The more I see of them, the more curious I'm
becoming."</p>

<p>"Ben Ali, pard," grinned McGlory, "is a little bit
curious about us, I reckon, from the way he's pryin'
around. How do you account for that?"</p>

<p>Matt shook his head.</p>

<p>"I can't account for it, Joe, but perhaps we'll be able
to do so later." He got up. "How about something to
eat?" he asked. "We'll have to have dinner, then take
something to the boys, and get busy patching up the
aëroplane."</p>

<p>"Did you ever know me to shy at a meal?" asked
McGlory, promptly getting up. "We'll hit the chuck layout,
and then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was nearly time for the doors to open, and inside
and out the two big "tops" there was a bustle of preparation.
The "spielers" in the ticket stands at the side-show
were yelling, people were crowding about the ticket
wagon, where they were to buy pasteboards admitting
them to the "big show," and a band was playing in the
road beyond the grounds.</p>

<p>Above all these various sounds there came a call, wild
and frantic. It reached the ears of the two boys in the
calliope tent with strange distinctness, and cut McGlory
short while he was talking.</p>

<p>"Helup! Helup, somepody, or I vas a goner!"</p>

<p>The cowboy gave a jump for the door, only a foot or
two behind Matt.</p>

<p>"Was that your Dutch pard?" cried McGlory.</p>

<p>"It was his voice, plain enough," answered Matt, looking
around sharply.</p>

<p>"What could have gone wrong with him?"</p>

<p>"I can't imagine&mdash;here, in broad daylight, with the
grounds full of people."</p>

<p>"It's trouble of the worst kind if we're to take the
words as they sounded."</p>

<p>Matt believed this fully. Carl Pretzel was not the
lad to give a false alarm, and he had clearly put his
whole heart into the words Matt and McGlory had
heard.</p>

<p>"Where did the call come from?" went on McGlory,
mystified.</p>

<p>"It seemed to come from everywhere, and from nowhere,"
replied Matt. "Look into the menagerie tent,
Joe."</p>

<p>While McGlory was lifting the canvas and taking a
look through the animal show, Matt rounded the outside
of the lean-to, searching every place with keen eyes.</p>

<p>Carl was nowhere to be found. As Matt drifted back
toward the door of the calliope tent, McGlory emerged
and joined him.</p>

<p>"He's not mixed up with the animals," reported the
cowboy.</p>

<p>"And I can't get any trace of him out here," said
Matt. "Let's walk over to the aëroplane. Carl and
Ping were to watch the machine, and I'm pretty sure
neither of them would leave it without orders unless
something pretty serious had gone wrong."</p>

<p>Vaguely alarmed, the two chums pushed their way
through the crowd toward the place where the <i>Comet</i>
had been left.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">BLACK MAGIC.</p>


<p>While the parade was passing through town, Carl
had been "sleuthing." The fact that he was wearing
McGlory's working clothes gave him an idea. He didn't
look like himself, so why not be some one else? All
the detective books he had ever read had a good deal to
say about disguises. Carl was already disguised, so he
made up his mind that he would be a dago laborer.</p>

<p>After watching the parade file out of the show
grounds, he slouched over to the side-show tent. A man
was just finishing lacing the picture of a wild man to
the guy ropes. Carl shuffled up to him.</p>

<p>"I peen der Idaliano man," he remarked, in a wonderful
combination of Dutch and Italian dialect, "und I,
peen make-a der look for a leedl-a gal mit der name
oof Manners. Haf-a you seen-a der girl aroundt loose
some-a-veres?"</p>

<p>The canvasman looked Carl over, and then, being
of a grouchy disposition, and thinking Carl was trying
to make fun of him, he gave him a push that landed
him against a banner containing a painted portrait of
the elastic-skin man. The banner was even more elastic
than the image it bore on its surface, for Carl rebounded
and struck one of the "barkers," who happened
to be passing with his hands full of ice-cream
cones for the bearded lady and the Zulu chief.</p>

<p>Disaster happened. The "barker" fell, with the Dutch
"tedectif" on top of him&mdash;and the ice-cream cones in
between.</p>

<p>The "barker" indulged in violent language, and began
using his hands. Carl was pretty good at that himself,
and retaliated. Two canvasmen pulled the two apart.
Carl had the contents of a cone in his hair, and the
"barker" had the contents of another down the back
of his neck.</p>

<p>"Where'd that ijut come from?" yelled the "barker,"
dancing up and down among the broken cones.</p>

<p>"Who left der cage toor oben?" cried Carl, digging
at his hair. "Der papoon vas esgaped."</p>

<p>"You put up your lightning rod," growled the
"barker," "or you'll git hit with a large wad of electricity."</p>

<p>"Come on mit it!" whooped Carl, fanning the air with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
his fists. "No vone can make some ice-gream freezers
oudt oof me mitoudt hafing drouples!"</p>

<p>"That'll do you," snorted the canvasman who had hold
of Carl, and thereupon raced him for twenty feet and
gave him a shove that turned him head over heels across
a guy rope.</p>

<p>"Dot's der vay," mourned Carl, picking himself up
and gathering in his hat. "Der tedectif pitzness comes
by hardt knocks, und nodding else. Vere can I do some
more?"</p>

<p>His head felt cold and uncomfortable, even after he
had mopped it dry with a red cotton handkerchief.</p>

<p>He went over to the horse tent. The tent was nearly
empty, all the live stock except a trick mule being in
the parade. The mule would not have been there, but he
was too tricky to trust in the procession. A man with
a red shirt, and his sleeves rolled up, sat on a bale
of hay close to the mule. The man was smoking.</p>

<p>"Hello, vonce," flagged Carl.</p>

<p>"Hello yourself," answered the man.</p>

<p>"I peen some Idaliano mans," remarked Carl, "und
I vas make-a der look for Markaret Manners, yes.
Haf-a you seen-a der gal?"</p>

<p>"Take a sneak," said the man.</p>

<p>"She iss-a leedle-a gal aboudt so high, yes," and
Carl put out his hand. "I peen-a der poor Idaliano man,
aber I gif-a you fife tollars, py shiminy, oof-a you tell-a
me where-a der gal iss."</p>

<p>"You can't josh me," went on the man earnestly.
"Hike, before I knock off your block."</p>

<p>Carl continued to stand his ground and ask questions;
then, the next thing he knew, the hostler had jumped
up and rushed for him. Carl sprang back to get out of
the way, unfortunately pushing against the hind heels
of the mule. The mule knew what to do, in the circumstances,
and did it with vigor.</p>

<p>Carl was kicked against the man with the pipe, and
that worthy turned a back somersault as neatly as any
"kinker" belonging to the show.</p>

<p>The Dutch boy limped hastily around the end of the
horse tent and crawled into an empty canvas wagon.
The mule's heels had struck him with the force of a
battering-ram, and he felt weak up and down the small
of the back. Besides, the wagon was a good place in
which to hide from the hostler.</p>

<p>Cautiously he watched over the wagon's side. The
hostler came around the side of the tent, looked in all
directions, and then retired, muttering, in the direction
of the bale of hay.</p>

<p>Carl chuckled as he dropped down on a roll of extra
canvas, but the chuckle died in a whimper as he became
conscious of his sore spots.</p>

<p>"I vonder how Cherlock Holmes efer lifed to do vat
he dit," he murmured, curling up on the canvas. "Der
tedectif pitzness iss hit und miss from vone end to der
odder, und den I don'd get some revards. Meppy I vill
shleep und forged id."</p>

<p>When Carl woke up, he looked over the side of the
wagon and saw a burning flying machine in the air, and
he heard the wild yells of the crowd. Probably it was
the yelling that awoke him.</p>

<p>"Py shinks," he cried, "dot's my bard, Modor Matt!
He iss purnin' oop mit himseluf. Fire! Fire! Helup!"
and Carl rolled out of the wagon and raced toward the
spot where the machine seemed to be coming down.</p>

<p>McGlory, white-faced but determined, was marshaling
a lot of men with buckets of water. Carl dropped in.
When the machine landed, he set to with the rest and
helped extinguish the flames.</p>

<p>Then, after he had congratulated Matt, Carl and Ping
were placed on guard.</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that Carl had shaken hands with
Ping, he continued to have very little use for the Chinaman.
And Ping, to judge from appearances, had no
more use for the Dutchman. They did not speak. One
sat down on one side of the machine and the other sat
down on the other. Then a brown man, wearing an
embroidered coat and a turban, drove up on a small
cage wagon drawn by one horse. He got off the wagon
and stepped up to Carl.</p>

<p>"How-do, sahib?" said the man.</p>

<p>Carl remembered him. He was the fellow who had
been dozing on Rajah's back at the river. Also he was
the man who had taken charge of the girl who had
dropped off the trapeze when the burning aëroplane
came down.</p>

<p>Carl had a startling thought&mdash;it flashed over him
like an inspiration.</p>

<p>"How you vas?" answered the Dutch boy genially.</p>

<p>"You come 'long with Ben Ali," said the man.</p>

<p>"Nod on your dindype," replied Carl. "I vas vatching
der machine for Modor Matt."</p>

<p>"<i>You come!</i>" hissed Ben Ali.</p>

<p>Then Carl noted something very remarkable. The
Hindoo's eyes began to blaze, and dance, and show wonderful
lights in their depths.</p>

<p>"Shtop mit it!" said Carl. "You peen a mesmerizer,
und I don'd like dot."</p>

<p>Carl knew he couldn't be hypnotized against his will,
but the Hindoo's eyes were working havoc with his
nerves.</p>

<p>"<i>You come!</i>"</p>

<p>The words of Ben Ali were imperative. Carl, seemingly
unable to remove his own eyes from the Hindoo's,
followed as Ben Ali retreated toward the wagon. At
the end of the wagon Ben Ali made some passes with
his hands in front of Carl's face, then opened the door.</p>

<p>"You get in, sahib!"</p>

<p>Carl climbed into the wagon mechanically. Slam went
the door and click went a key in the padlock.</p>

<p>The <i>Comet</i> had come down from its disastrous flight
at a considerable distance from the tents. There were
no people in the immediate vicinity save Ping.</p>

<p>The little Chinaman, on hands and knees under the
lower wing of the aëroplane, was watching covertly all
that took place.</p>

<p>After locking the door of the cage wagon, Ben Ali
took a cautious look around him. He saw no one.</p>

<p>Climbing up on one of the forward wheels, he took a
slouch hat and a long linen duster from the seat, removed
his embroidered coat and his turban, got into the
hat and duster, climbed to the seat, picked up the reins,
and drove off.</p>

<p>Ping had seen it all, but had made no attempt to interfere.
And he made no attempt now.</p>

<p>He did not like the "Dutchy boy." He was afraid
Carl would take away from him his job with Motor
Matt.</p>

<p>It was with secret rejoicing, therefore, that the Chinaman
saw Carl locked in the wagon and hauled away.</p>

<p>"Hoop-a-la!" chattered Ping, as he returned to his
place and once more went on watch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>The wagon used by Ben Ali, on this momentous occasion,
was technically known as the monkey wagon.
Two of the monkeys had eaten something which did not
agree with them, and had died in Indianapolis. The three
that remained had been taken out and put in another
cage, with a collection known as "The Happy Family."
This, of course, left the monkey wagon empty.</p>

<p>Burton was figuring on using it for one of the ant-eaters,
but there were some repairs to be made before
the wagon could be put to that use. The repairs dragged,
and so Ben Ali found his opportunity to use the cage.</p>

<p>Straight across the show grounds drove the disguised
Hindoo. None of the employees who saw him recognized
him or questioned his right to use the monkey
wagon. Different gangs had different duties, and no one
knew but that this strange driver was off to town on
some important mission.</p>

<p>Ben Ali drove within a hundred feet of the calliope
tent. When he was well beyond it, a yell came from
inside the wagon.</p>

<p>"Helup! Helup, somepody, or I vas a goner!"</p>

<p>A shiver ran through Ben Ali. He made ready to
leap from the wagon, but thought better of it when
he saw that the call had attracted no attention and was
not repeated.</p>

<p>"Sahib keep still!" he called, kicking the end of the
wagon with his heels.</p>

<p>And thus, with not a sound coming from the interior
of the monkey wagon, the artful Hindoo adept drove
into the road and headed the horse away from the
town and into the country.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">THE MAHOUT'S FLIGHT.</p>


<p>When Matt and McGlory, hurrying to the aëroplane to
make inquiries concerning Carl, came within sight of
Ping, they saw him calmly occupied twirling a set of
jackstones.</p>

<p>"Ping!" called Matt.</p>

<p>"Awri'!" answered Ping, slipping the jackstones into
a pocket of his blouse and immediately getting up.</p>

<p>"Where's Carl?"</p>

<p>"Dutchy boy no good. Him lun away."</p>

<p>"Run away?" echoed McGlory. "Here's a slam!
When and how, Ping?"</p>

<p>"Ben Ali dlive 'lound in wagon. Him say to Dutchy
boy, 'You come.' Dutchy boy makee come chop-chop.
Ben Ali shuttee do', put on Melican coat, Melican hat,
makee dlive off. Woosh! Dutchy boy no good."</p>

<p>This offhand description of what had happened to
Carl was received with startled wonder by Matt and
McGlory.</p>

<p>"When was this?" demanded Matt.</p>

<p>"Plaps fi' minit, plaps ten minit. No gottee clock,
Motol Matt; no savvy time."</p>

<p>"You say Ben Ali drove up in a wagon?"</p>

<p>"Dlive up in monkey wagon. Put Dutchy boy in monkey
wagon."</p>

<p>"And then he locked Carl inside?"</p>

<p>"Allee same."</p>

<p>"And took off his turban and embroidered coat and
replaced them with another hat and coat?"</p>

<p>"Melican hat, plenty long coat."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't that rattle your spurs, pard?" murmured
McGlory.</p>

<p>"What did Ben Ali do?" went on Matt, resolved to
get at the bottom of the matter, if possible.</p>

<p>"Him makee funny look with eye," replied Ping. "By
Klismus! him blame' funny look. One piecee devil shine
in eye."</p>

<p>"Hypnotized!" grunted McGlory.</p>

<p>"You can't easily hypnotize a person against his will,"
averred Matt. "It's not hard to guess that Carl was
a good way from being willing to go with Ben Ali."</p>

<p>"What the dickens did Ben Ali want to run off Carl
for?" queried McGlory.</p>

<p>"This business gets more and more mysterious, Joe,"
returned Matt, "the farther we go into it."</p>

<p>"And that yell we heard!"</p>

<p>"That certainly came from Carl. Ben Ali must have
driven past the calliope tent while we were talking inside.
The fact that Carl gave a yell for help proves
that he wasn't wholly hypnotized."</p>

<p>"He may have come out from under the influence
just long enough to give a whoop," suggested the
cowboy.</p>

<p>"Let's go back and hunt up Burton," said Matt.
"He'll want his monkey wagon, and, of course, we've
got to get hold of Carl."</p>

<p>"It's news to discover that Ben Ali is a hypnotist,"
observed McGlory, as he and Matt whirled and started
to retrace the ground over which they had just passed.</p>

<p>"I told you these Hindoos were a crafty set," answered
Matt.</p>

<p>The doors were open and the crowd was vanishing
inside the big tents. The grounds were not so congested
with people as they had been, and it was easier to get
about and hunt for Burton.</p>

<p>As it chanced, they ran plump into the manager just
as they were rounding the dressing tent at the end of
the circus "top."</p>

<p>Burton was red and perspiring, and there was wrath
in his face.</p>

<p>"I've been looking all around for you fellows," he
cried. "You can run one of these here buzz-wagons,
can't you, Matt?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Matt, "but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Come along," interrupted Burton, grabbing Matt by
the arm, "we haven't any time to spare."</p>

<p>"Wait!" protested Matt, drawing back. "Have you
seen&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Can't wait," fumed Burton. "I've hired a chug-car;
and there's a race on. Haidee has skipped. Aurung
Zeeb, one of the other Hindoo mahouts, has helped her
get away. They've taken my runabout. Confound such
blooming luck, anyhow!"</p>

<p>Here was news, and no mistake. Ben Ali running off
with Carl, and Aurung Zeeb taking to the open with
the showman's Kentucky cob and rubber-tired buggy!</p>

<p>"Do you know where Aurung Zeeb and Haidee
went?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"I haven't the least notion," was the wrathful answer,
"but we've got to find them. I don't care a straw
about Zeeb, or the girl, but that runabout rig is worth
six hundred dollars, just as it stands."</p>

<p>"Well, if you don't know which way the rig went,"
argued Matt, "it's foolish to go chasing them and depending
on luck to point the way."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>"We've got to do something!" declared Burton.</p>

<p>"Where's Ben Ali?"</p>

<p>"Oh, hang Ben Ali! I haven't seen him since he
flashed that knife in my face."</p>

<p>"We've just discovered," proceeded Matt, "that he
has skipped out, too, and taken your monkey wagon
along."</p>

<p>"Sure of that?"</p>

<p>"Ping just told us. Not only that, Burton, but he
took my Dutch pard&mdash;the lad that came this morning&mdash;with
him. Carl was locked in the cage."</p>

<p>"Worse and worse," ground out Burton. "How'd
Ben Ali ever manage to do that?"</p>

<p>"On the face of it, I should say that Ben Ali had
hypnotized Carl."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! What does an elephant driver know
about hypnotism? Still, this begins to look like a comprehensive
plan to steal a monkey wagon and a runabout
and leave me in the lurch. What do you think
of that Haidee girl to do a thing like this? She seemed
mighty anxious to earn money, yet here she skips out
with about a hundred in cash to her credit."</p>

<p>"It's hard to understand the turn events have taken,"
said Matt. "But I wouldn't blame Haidee too much
until you know more about her&mdash;and about Ben Ali."</p>

<p>"I want my horses and my rolling stock," fretted
Burton. "The rest of the outfit can go hang, if I get
back the plunder."</p>

<p>"You said something about an automobile," said Matt.</p>

<p>"There's a car here, and the man that owns it is seeing
the show. He said I could have the use of the car all
afternoon for fifty dollars. He thought I was an easy
mark, and I let him think so. He's got the money and
I've got the car. After he'd gone inside, I happened
to remember that I couldn't run the thing, so I chased
off looking for you. Here we are," and the three, who
had been walking in the direction of the road, came to
the side of a large automobile.</p>

<p>It was a good machine, with all of six cylinders under
the hood.</p>

<p>"If you're a mind reader, and can tell where we ought
to go, Burton," said Motor Matt, "I'll get you there.
I feel right at home when I'm in the driver's seat of
a motor car."</p>

<p>"Wait till I ask somebody," and Burton whirled and
flew away.</p>

<p>"Gone to have some fortune teller read his palm,"
laughed McGlory. "Oh, but he's wild when he gets
started."</p>

<p>"I don't blame him for worrying," said Matt. "He
was offered four hundred, spot cash, for that Kentucky
cob, in Indianapolis. Shouldn't wonder if he stood to
lose a thousand dollars if the runaways can't be overhauled.
And he hasn't much time to overhaul them,
either, Joe. The three sections of the show train have
got to be on the move toward South Bend by three in
the morning. I'm worried some myself, on Carl's account.
What has that crafty mahout got at the back of
his head? I wish I knew. You and I are going to stay
right here in Lafayette until we can find out something
about Carl."</p>

<p>"Sure we are," agreed the cowboy heartily. "But here
comes Burton, and he looks as though he'd found out
something."</p>

<p>"One of the canvasmen," announced Burton breathlessly,
as he came up with the boys, "says that he saw
the monkey wagon heading south into the country. Can't
find out which way the runabout headed, but we'll take
after the other outfit. Get in and drive the machine for
all you're worth."</p>

<p>Matt passed around in front, and was pleased with
the business-like manner in which the motor took up
its cycle.</p>

<p>"Here's where we throw in the high-speed clutch and
scoot," said Matt, settling into the driver's seat with a
glad feeling tingling along his nerves. It had suddenly
occurred to him that he would rather motor in a high-powered
car than do anything else that had so far
claimed his attention. In such a machine, "miles were
his minions and distance his slave." "Here we go," he
finished, and away bounded the car.</p>

<p>Matt took time to wonder at the nature of a plutocrat
who, for fifty dollars, would trust such a beautiful
piece of mechanism in the hands of a showman. But the
fact was accomplished, and guesses at the reason were
futile.</p>

<p>They came to a hill&mdash;a steepish kind of a hill, too&mdash;and
they went over it without a change of gear. Motor
Matt laughed exultantly.</p>

<p>"Took it on the high speed!" he cried. "A car that
can do that is a corker."</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the hill, as they were scorching
down with the speedometer needle playing around
the fifty-eight mark, a team and wagon containing a
farmer and his family were almost backed off the road.
Matt tampered with the brakes, but the car was going
too fast to feel the bind of the brake grip.</p>

<p>"Never mind!" cried Burton, from his place at Matt's
side. "That outfit is going to the show to-night. If I
see 'em, I'll pass 'em all in with fifty-cent chairs. Now,
boy, hit 'er up. I've got to recover my property before
night sets in, and this may be a long chase."</p>

<p>"Long chase!" yelped McGlory derisively from the
tonneau. "How can it be a long chase when we're going
like this? Hang on to your hair, Burton! Mile-a-minute
Matt's at the steering wheel."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE PAPER TRAIL.</p>


<p>The coils hummed merrily to the six-cylinder accompaniment.
The wind whistled and sang in the ears of
the three who were plunging along at a speed which
was bound to get them somewhere in short order.</p>

<p>Then, as might be expected, something happened. It
was no accident to the car. The road spread apart in
two equally well-traveled branches, and Matt shut off
and came to a stop at the forks.</p>

<p>"The canvasman, of course," said the young motorist,
looking around at Burton, "couldn't tell you which fork
the monkey wagon would take."</p>

<p>"Here's a go!" muttered Burton. "If we take one
fork, we may be hustling off on the wrong scent. At
a guess, I should say take the right-hand branch."</p>

<p>"Let's not do any guessing until we have to," Matt
returned. "My cowboy chum here is a good hand at
picking up trails. Show us how they do it in Arizona,
Joe."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>McGlory was out of the car in a flash and giving his
attention to the surface of the road.</p>

<p>"You might as well try to hunt for the print of a
rabbit's foot in the trail of a herd of stampeded steers,"
said McGlory, after five precious minutes spent in fruitless
examination.</p>

<p>"What sort of a cowboy are you, anyhow?" scoffed
Burton.</p>

<p>"Well, look," answered McGlory. "The ground is all
cut up with people coming to the show, and it's none
too soft. I couldn't pick out the tread of a traction
thrashing machine in all this jumble of prints."</p>

<p>"Any one coming on either road?" queried Burton,
standing up and looking. "If there is, we could inquire
as to whether they'd passed the monkey wagon."</p>

<p>"See any one?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"Not a soul," and the showman plumped disappointedly
down in his seat.</p>

<p>"Just a minute, Joe," interposed Matt, as the cowboy
was about to climb back into the tonneau. "What's that
white object in the road?" Matt pointed as he spoke.
"There's one, just over the left-hand fork, and another
beyond it."</p>

<p>"If you stop to bother with paper scraps," cried Burton,
"we'll never get anywhere."</p>

<p>McGlory, however, turned back and picked up the
object to which Matt had called his attention.</p>

<p>It was a scrap of paper, just as Burton had said.
The scrap was a ragged square, as though it had been
roughly torn, and measured about two inches across.</p>

<p>The cowboy examined it casually at first, then his
face changed, and he gave it closer attention.</p>

<p>"My handwriting," he declared, looking up at Matt.</p>

<p>"How can that be?" scoffed Burton.</p>

<p>"I don't know how it can be," replied McGlory, "but
it's a fact, all the same. I had a memorandum book,
and have jotted down various things in it."</p>

<p>"Where'd you leave the memorandum book?" jested
the showman impatiently; "in the monkey wagon?"</p>

<p>"Nary, I didn't. I left it in the hip pocket of my
working clothes."</p>

<p>"And Carl had on the clothes!" exclaimed Matt, with
a jubilant ring in his voice. "Carl must have scattered
that trail for our benefit."</p>

<p>He stood up in the automobile and looked back over
the road they had traveled.</p>

<p>"Why," he went on, "we haven't been as observing as
we should have been. There's a paper trail, and Carl
must have started it pretty soon after the monkey wagon
left the show grounds."</p>

<p>"Well, well!" muttered Burton. "Say, Matt, that
Dutch chum of yours is quite a lad, after all. The idea
of his thinking of that."</p>

<p>"Carl always has his head with him," declared Matt.
"Climb in, Joe. The left fork for ours."</p>

<p>McGlory pulled the crank, before he got in, for the
stop had killed the engine.</p>

<p>"It's a cinch," said McGlory, as he resumed his place
in the tonneau, "that Carl wasn't hypnotized when he
dropped those scraps. How <i>could</i> he drop 'em? That's
what beats me. Why, he was locked in, so Ping said."</p>

<p>"There was a hole in the floor," explained Burton.
"Not a very big one, but big enough for an ant-eater
to get a foot through. I was going to repair the cage,
but haven't had time to attend to it."</p>

<p>"Why didn't Carl yell again?" went on McGlory. "If
he had yelled long enough, and loud enough, some one
would have been bound to hear him and stop Ben Ali."</p>

<p>"This is another case where Carl's using his head,"
put in Matt. "He's playing some dodge or other."</p>

<p>"He's showing up a whole lot stronger than I ever
imagined he could," said the cowboy. "I had sized him
up for a two-spot at any sort of headwork. Got my
opinion, I reckon, from the way those Chicago detectives
fooled him."</p>

<p>"He's not so slow as you imagine, Joe," said Matt.
"Now keep an eye out for scraps!"</p>

<p>"We can't get into a scrap with those Hindoos any
too quick to suit me," laughed McGlory, hanging out
over the side of the motor car.</p>

<p>Once more the whirling, headlong rush of the car
was resumed. No sooner had Burton, or McGlory, discovered
a bit of white in the roadway ahead than it was
lost to sight behind.</p>

<p>Then, after four or five miles of this, the three in
the car raised an object, drawn up at the roadside,
which brought the car to a halt. The object was the
monkey wagon, horse gone from the shafts, rear door
swinging open, and not a soul in the vicinity.</p>

<p>"Here's another queer twist," grumbled Burton, as all
three got out to make a close survey of the wagon.
"What do you think of it, Matt?"</p>

<p>Matt and McGlory thrust their heads in at the door.</p>

<p>"Phew!" gurgled the cowboy, drawing back. "There's
a mineral well, in Lafayette, that's a dead ringer for
the smell inside that cage wagon."</p>

<p>"I haven't had it swabbed out yet," apologized Burton.</p>

<p>"Here's the hole where Carl dropped out the paper
scraps," Matt called, from inside the wagon.</p>

<p>"And here's something else, pard!" yelled McGlory.</p>

<p>Matt came out of the wagon and found his cowboy
chum calling Burton's attention to marks in the road.</p>

<p>"What do you make of it, Joe?" asked Matt, coming
closer.</p>

<p>"Well," answered McGlory, reading the "signs," "a
one-horse buggy with rubber tires stopped here, alongside
the monkey wagon. Look how the road's tramped up,
ahead there. The horse was restive during the halt, and
did some pawing."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>"Great guns!" murmured Burton. "My runabout!"</p>

<p>"I think it's pretty clear now," observed Matt. "Aurung
Zeeb and Haidee didn't get away at the same time
Ben Ali and Carl did, or else they took a different
course. Anyhow, they came up with the wagon. The
runabout's faster, so the whole party went on with it."</p>

<p>"They might get three people into the runabout, by
crowding," said Burton, "but they never could get four
people into it."</p>

<p>"That's why the horse was taken from the monkey
wagon," went on Matt. "Aurung Zeeb or Ben Ali must
have ridden the animal."</p>

<p>"By Jove, King, I wish I had your head for getting
at things! That was the way of it&mdash;it <i>must</i> have been
the way of it. Let's pile back into the machine and
hustle on."</p>

<p>They all felt that the chase was drawing to a close.
The runabout was a faster vehicle than the monkey
wagon, but there was not the ghost of a show for the
Kentucky horse getting away from the automobile.</p>

<p>From that point on, the paper trail was not in evidence.</p>

<p>"Carl wasn't able to drop any more scraps," said
Matt. "When he was inside the monkey wagon he was
out of sight and could do about as he pleased; crowded
into the runabout with Ben Ali and Haidee, and with
Aurung Zeeb riding behind, he couldn't possibly drop
a clue to guide us."</p>

<p>"The Dutchman seems to have taken it for granted
that he'd be followed," hazarded Burton.</p>

<p>"He knows very well," returned Matt, "that I
wouldn't stand around and let him worry through this
run of hard luck alone. Look out for the runabout.
The way I figure it, the rig can't be more than ten or
fifteen minutes ahead of us."</p>

<p>"How do you figure it, Matt?" asked Burton.</p>

<p>"Well, from the time Joe and I heard Carl call for
help. I don't believe it was more than half an hour
from that time until we were hitting the high places
with this automobile. Eh, Joe?"</p>

<p>"No more than that, pard," answered McGlory.</p>

<p>"I should think we'd have gained more than fifteen or
twenty minutes on the Hindoos, the rate we've been coming,"
remarked Burton.</p>

<p>"Possibly we have. If that's so, then the runabout
can't be even ten minutes ahead of us. Now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Runabout!" yelled McGlory.</p>

<p>He was standing up in the tonneau and peering ahead.
The road, at this point, was bordered with heavy timber
on both sides, but in half a minute Matt and Burton
could each see the vehicle to which the cowboy had
called their attention.</p>

<p>It wasn't a runabout, as it proved, but a two-seated
"democrat" wagon, drawn by a team, and conveying
another party townward&mdash;presumably for the evening
performance of the Big Consolidated.</p>

<p>McGlory's disappointment was keen. And his feelings,
for that matter, were matched by those of Motor
Matt and Burton.</p>

<p>Matt halted the automobile and, when the wagon came
alongside, asked the driver if he had been passed by
a runabout farther along the road.</p>

<p>The party had come five miles on that road and,
according to the driver, hadn't been passed by anything
on wheels going the other way.</p>

<p>For a space those in the automobile were in a
quandary.</p>

<p>"What's amiss?" fumed Burton. "Are we on the
wrong track, after all, in spite of your Dutch friend
and his paper trail, and McGlory's reading the signs at
the monkey wagon?"</p>

<p>Matt suddenly threw in the reverse and began to turn.</p>

<p>"Only one thing could have happened," he averred.</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"Why, the people in the runabout must have heard
us coming and turned from the road into the woods."</p>

<p>"Let her out on the back track, then!" cried Burton.
"If the Hindoos think they've dodged us, they've probably
pulled out into the road and started the other way."</p>

<p>This seemed to have been the case, for three minutes
speeding over the return trail brought those in the automobile
in sight of the runabout.</p>

<p>This time it <i>was</i> the runabout, and no mistake, and
the Kentucky cob was stretching out like a race horse
under the frantic plying of a whip.</p>

<p>Burton reached behind him, under his coat, and
brought a revolver into view.</p>

<p>"We'll find out about this business before we're many
minutes older!" he exclaimed grimly.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">CARL TURNS A TRICK.</p>


<p>Something has been said about Carl Pretzel having an
idea that was almost an inspiration, at the time he was
approached by the Hindoo at the aëroplane.</p>

<p>This it was that led him into the monkey wagon. The
slam of the door and the grate of the key in the padlock
struck a sudden tremor to the Dutch boy's heart.</p>

<p>Was he making a fool of himself or not? Would a
trained detective have proceeded in that manner?</p>

<p>His heart failed him, and he gave the wild yell for
help.</p>

<p>He had hardly given the cry before he repented of it.
What would Motor Matt think of his nerve if he could
know the game he had embarked upon, and how he had
been stampeded in playing it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>No; if that call had done no harm, Carl would not
repeat it. He would see the business through and try
and match wits with the Hindoo.</p>

<p>In spite of the noise on the show grounds, Carl
heard Ben Ali's heels bang against the end of the wagon,
and also the stern voice commanding him to keep silent.</p>

<p>Carl kept silent. He was almost smothered by the
closeness of his prison chamber, and the terrific odor
that assailed him, but he comforted himself with the
thought that detectives don't always have things their
own way when they're tracking down a criminal. Anyhow,
even his present discomfort was better than the
hard knocks his "sleuthing" had so far given him.</p>

<p>He was not long in discovering the hole in the floor
of the wagon. The memorandum book he had discovered
soon after getting into the borrowed clothes.</p>

<p>Of course he knew that Motor Matt would follow
him! That was the kind of fellow the king of the motor
boys was; never had he turned his back on a pard in distress.</p>

<p>Carl, too, was morally certain that Ping had seen him
get into the monkey wagon. Motor Matt would discover
this from the Chinaman, and then would come the
pursuit.</p>

<p>The thing for Carl to do was to point the way by
which he had been carried off. The hole in the floor,
and the memorandum book in his pocket, were not long
in giving him the right tip.</p>

<p>Sitting down on the bottom of the cage, Carl occupied
himself in tearing the leaves of the book into scraps and
poking the scraps through the opening.</p>

<p>How far Ben Ali drove Carl did not know, but it
seemed as though the Hindoo had been hours on the
road. There was a pain in Carl's back, where the mule
had left its token of remembrance, and the jolt of the
wagon was far from pleasant.</p>

<p>Presently there came the rapid beat of a horse's hoofs,
a whir of wheels, and a sudden stop of the monkey
wagon. The other sounds ceased at the same moment.</p>

<p>For a second or two Carl imagined that Matt had
overhauled Ben Ali, but this fancy was dispelled by the
strange words that passed between Ben Ali and some
one else.</p>

<p>The mahout could be heard climbing swiftly down
from his perch and moving around to the rear of the
wagon. Carl slipped the book into his pocket and drew
away from the hole in the floor.</p>

<p>Once more the key grated in the padlock. The door
was drawn open and Ben Ali was revealed, looming
large in the rush of sunlight, a bared knife in his hand.</p>

<p>"You come, sahib," said Ben Ali.</p>

<p>Carl got up and moved toward the door. There Ben
Ali caught his eyes for a space and held them with the
same weird looks indulged in near the aëroplane on the
show grounds.</p>

<p>The Dutchman instantly grew automatic in his movements,
keeping his eyes straight ahead and following
Ben Ali's every gesture.</p>

<p>Carl had seen persons hypnotized, and knew how they
acted.</p>

<p>"You come," repeated Ben Ali sternly, and Carl
jumped down from the wagon.</p>

<p>They were in a country road. There was a smart-looking
horse and buggy beside the monkey wagon, and
Haidee was on the seat. If appearances were to be believed,
she was in another of her spells.</p>

<p>"Sahib get in de buggy," ordered Ben Ali.</p>

<p>Carl climbed over the wheel obediently and sat down
beside the girl. She paid not the least attention to him,
nor he to her. Ben Ali climbed in beside them, squeezed
into the seat, and took the reins from Haidee's hands.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Carl had been looking at another brown
man in a turban who was unhitching the horse from the
monkey wagon.</p>

<p>Ben Ali waited until the horse was out of the shafts
and the second Hindoo on its back, then he started the
Kentucky cob off along the road. His companion trotted
along behind.</p>

<p>Dropping any more paper scraps was out of the question.
Carl was too tightly wedged in between Ben Ali
and Haidee to use his hands; besides, he could not have
made a move that would not instantly have been seen.</p>

<p>Presently the Hindoo on the horse called out something
in his unknown jargon. Ben Ali answered, and
the runabout was turned from the road and into the
woods.</p>

<p>Possibly they proceeded a hundred feet into the timber.
At the end of that distance their progress was
halted by a creek with steep banks.</p>

<p>Ben Ali got out. While standing on the ground
facing Carl, he made sinuous movements with his slim
brown hands&mdash;passes, most probably, designed to keep
Carl in a hypnotic state.</p>

<p>The girl shuddered, suddenly, and drew a hand across
her eyes.</p>

<p>"Uncle Ben!" she exclaimed, with a sharp cry, "where
am I?"</p>

<p>"You are safe," said Ben Ali. "You are not to work
with de trapeze any more, not be with de show any
more. We are quit with de show. <i>Kabultah, meetoowah?</i>"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," breathed the girl, "I understand. But
where are we going? I don't want to be in a trance any
more. I want to know what I say, what I do&mdash;all the
time."</p>

<p>The man's face hardened.</p>

<p>"You come, Haidee," he said, gently but none the less
firmly.</p>

<p>The girl got up and climbed down from the wagon.</p>

<p>"Sahib!" he cried sharply. "You come, too."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>Carl likewise climbed to the ground.</p>

<p>"You are asleep," went on Ben Ali, coming up to
Carl and bringing his face close. "You know not anything
what you do. Sit!"</p>

<p>Carl sank down on the bank of the creek.</p>

<p>The other Hindoo had dismounted. Stepping away
from his horse, he turned the runabout rig the other
way, so that the cob faced the road. Then he tied the
animal.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ben Ali, seating himself cross-legged on
the ground, had drawn a small black box from his
breast. It was a lacquered box and shone like ebony in
the gleam of sun that drifted down through the trees.</p>

<p>Haidee uttered an exclamation and stretched out her
hands.</p>

<p>"It is mine, Uncle Ben! It belongs to me."</p>

<p>"Yis, <i>meetoowah</i>," agreed Ben Ali, "it belong to you,
but I keep it. That is safer, better."</p>

<p>He put down the box and listened, hissing to attract
the attention of the other Hindoo.</p>

<p>"Aurung Zeeb!"</p>

<p>The other turned, and Ben Ali motioned toward the
road.</p>

<p>The sound of an approaching motor car broke the stillness.
It grew rapidly in volume, passed a point abreast
of those in the woods, and went on, dying away in the
distance.</p>

<p>Excitement shone in the faces of the Hindoos, and
there was alarm in the face of the girl.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she cried. "Uncle Ben&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Silence, <i>meetooowah</i>!" commanded the Hindoo.</p>

<p>Taking the lacquered box in his hand, Ben Ali leaped
erect and chattered wildly with Aurung Zeeb. After that,
he came to Carl, his face full of anxiety and alarm, and
made more passes.</p>

<p>"You come," he ordered, "get back in de buggy."</p>

<p>Carl followed as Ben Ali backed away in the direction
of the runabout. The Hindoo stood close to the
wheel until Carl was in the seat.</p>

<p>At that moment a smothered scream came from Haidee.
Aurung Zeeb jumped toward her, letting go the
bridle of his horse as he did so. Ben Ali muttered
something under his breath, put the lacquered box on the
runabout seat beside Carl, and started toward Aurung
Zeeb and the girl.</p>

<p>"You must tell me what you are doing," panted the
girl, facing the Hindoos with flashing eyes. "That is
Boss Burton's horse and buggy. Why have you got the
rig here? What are we doing here? Tell me, Uncle
Ben! I must know."</p>

<p>Ben Ali tried to quiet her. Carl was in a quiver.
The lines were twined about the whip on the dashboard
of the runabout, and both Hindoos were fully fifteen
feet away. It looked like a propitious moment for escape.
Carl had not accomplished much, but he was patting
himself on the back because of the way he had
fooled Ben Ali. Now, if he could get away, and take
the runabout with him&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Carl never thought very long over any proposition.
Nor did he give much time to this.</p>

<p>Swooping down on the dashboard, he grabbed up the
lines and the whip.</p>

<p>"Gid ap mit yourself!" he yelled, and struck the horse.</p>

<p>With a snort the animal bounded forward, breaking
the strap that secured him to the tree and almost throwing
Carl from the seat.</p>

<p>The other horse took fright and bounded away, while
Carl went lurching and plunging in a wild dash for the
road.</p>

<p>How he ever reached the road without coming to
grief against the many trees he grazed in his dash was
something which would have puzzled a wiser head than
his.</p>

<p>He paid not the least attention to the Hindoos, nor
to Haidee. He was thinking of Carl, and trying to
guess how much money he would get for bringing back
the stolen horse and runabout.</p>

<p>For once, he thought exultantly, he was making the
detective business <i>pay</i>.</p>

<p>Whirling into the road, he headed the horse back toward
town, plying the whip and hustling the best he
knew how.</p>

<p>It was a marvel that the runabout held together. But
it did. Suddenly a firearm spoke sharply from somewhere
in the rear.</p>

<p>Carl did not look behind. He had but one thought,
and that was that the Hindoos must be phenomenal runners,
and that they were chasing him on foot and firing
as they came.</p>

<p>He bent forward over the dashboard and urged the
cob to a wilder pace.</p>

<p>Then, while he was using the whip, an angry voice
roared from alongside the runabout:</p>

<p>"Stop lashing that horse! Stop, I tell you!"</p>

<p>Carl became faintly aware that there was an automobile
dashing along the road side by side with the
runabout.</p>

<p>"Carl!" shouted a familiar voice. "Stop your running!
Don't you know who we are?"</p>

<p>Then the excited Dutchman became aware of the situation
and pulled back on the lines.</p>

<p>He chuckled delightedly as he jerked and sawed on
the bit.</p>

<p>He, Carl Pretzel, had been running away from his old
pard! What a joke!</p>

<p>And there, in the automobile with Matt, was the
manager of the show.</p>

<p>It wouldn't be long, now, before Carl found out how
much he was to get for recovering the stolen horse and
runabout.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE LACQUERED BOX.</p>


<p>Probably that Kentucky horse of Burton's had never
been treated in his life as he was that afternoon. He
was muddy with sweat and dust, and his high-strung
spirits, by that time thoroughly aroused, rebelled against
the curb.</p>

<p>In order to help Carl out, Motor Matt drove the car
past the horse and partly across the road. This served
to bring the animal to a halt.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" stormed Burton, "I wouldn't have had
this happen for a hundred dollars! It's a wonder if the
horse isn't ruined!"</p>

<p>He flopped out of the automobile and approached the
horse's head.</p>

<p>"Whoa, Colonel!" he murmured soothingly. "Whoa,
old boy!"</p>

<p>Then, getting one hand on the bit, he held the animal
while he petted and wheedled and patted the lathered
neck.</p>

<p>"Der rig vas shtole py der Hindoo," said Carl, "und
I haf recofered it und prought it pack. Dot comes oof
being a goot tedectif, py shinks! How mooch iss id
vort'?"</p>

<p>"Worth?" scowled Burton. "If the animal is injured
I'll charge you up for it. Don't you know how to take
care of a horse?"</p>

<p>"Don'd you vas going to pay me someding?" gasped
Carl.</p>

<p>"Pay?" snorted Burton, in no mood to consider a reward
after seeing his favorite horse mistreated. "Why, I
feel like I wanted to use the whip on you! What did
you run away from us for?"</p>

<p>"I t'ought you vas der Hindoos," explained Carl
feebly. "Say, Matt," he added, turning to his chum,
"der feller don't vas going to gif me someding! Vat a
miserliness! Und me going droo all vat I dit!"</p>

<p>"Where did you get the runabout, Carl?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>He thought Boss Burton was a little unreasonable, but
was not disposed to make any comments. Burton's ways
were sometimes far from meeting Matt's approval&mdash;and
they had never been farther from it than during the
events of that exciting day.</p>

<p>"I shteal him from der Hindoos," said Carl, "und
make some gedavays by der shkin oof my teet', you
bed you! I hat to run der horse, Matt, oder I vouldn't
have made der esgape. Vone oof der Hindoos had a
knife, und dey vas bot' det safage I can't dell. Der
odder horse vat pulled der cage vagon iss somevere
aheadt. He got avay und vent like some shdreaks."</p>

<p>"You climb down," snapped Burton, coming back to
the side of the runabout. "I'll take the rig back to the
grounds and send one of the teamsters for the monkey
wagon. You'll bring along the automobile, Matt?" he
added, getting into the runabout as Carl got out.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Matt.</p>

<p>"Ain't you going on with us to look up the Hindoos
and Haidee?" asked McGlory. "Going to hang back
before we run out the trail, Burton?"</p>

<p>"I don't care anything about them," was the reply,
"so long as I've recovered my own property. What's
this?" and the showman picked up the lacquered box.</p>

<p>Carl stared at it. Evidently he had forgotten all about
it, up to that moment.</p>

<p>"Py chimineddy!" he muttered. "Dot's der Hindoo's!
He tropped id on der seat pefore I run avay mit der
rig."</p>

<p>"Then I'll take it with me," said Burton. "Perhaps
it's of enough value so that the rascal will come after
it. If he does, I can read the riot act to him."</p>

<p>"I guess you'd better leave that with Carl, Burton,"
spoke up Matt. "You don't care to bother with the Hindoos,
and we may think it's worth while."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, if that's the way you feel about it," and
the showman tossed the box to Carl. "Mind," he added,
as he started off, "you're not to get into any trouble with
that automobile."</p>

<p>Burton was soon out of sight.</p>

<p>"He's the limit, that fellow!" growled McGlory. "He
might have tipped Carl a five-case note, but he wouldn't.
He's a skinner."</p>

<p>"Nodding doing in der tedectif pitzness," said Carl resignedly,
getting into the automobile beside Matt.
"Same like alvays I ged der vorst oof id. Vile vorking
on der Manners gase, I haf peen in a row mit Ping, in
a row mit a canvasman und a 'parker' for der site-show,
in some more rows mit a shtable feller, got kicked in der

feller he say he vould like to pound me mit der vip.
Ach, vell, ve can't pecome greadt tedectifs mitoudt a
leedle hardt luck at her shtart."</p>

<p>"Tell us what happened to you, Carl," said Matt, "and
be quick about it."</p>

<p>Carl sketched his adventures, with now and then an
urging toward brevity from Matt.</p>

<p>"Ven I see dot Hindoo coming, at der time he made
some brisoners oof me," expounded Carl, on reaching
that part of his recital, "I remempered der girl vat come
down in der flying machine, und vat he valked avay mit,
und I got der t'ought, like lightning, dot meppy der
feller know someding aboudt Markaret Manners, vat

anyt'ing."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>Carl's disgust was great, and he brought his story to a
quick conclusion.</p>

<p>"We'll go look for the Hindoos and Haidee," said
Matt. "As I jog along, Carl, you keep watch for the
place where you turned from the road. Meanwhile,
Joe," Matt added, "you take the lacquered box and open
it. We'll see what's inside. The contents may shed a
little light on this mystery of the girl."</p>

<p>"Der Hindoos und der girl von't be vere dey vas,"
remarked Carl, handing the box to McGlory.</p>

<p>"They can't possibly be far away," answered Matt.
"They have to travel on foot, now, and will be compelled
to go slow."</p>

<p>"This box is locked, pard," called McGlory.</p>

<p>"Force the lid, then," said Matt. "It's necessary, according
to my notion, that we try and find out something
about Haidee. And for the girl's good."</p>

<p>McGlory opened his pocketknife and inserted the
blade between the box and the lid. The lock splintered
out under pressure.</p>

<p>"She's open, pard," announced the cowboy.</p>

<p>"What's inside?"</p>

<p>"A bundle of letters tied with a piece of twine."</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>"They have English stamps," went on McGlory, "and
are postmarked at London."</p>

<p>"Better and better! And they're addressed to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Miss Margaret Manners, Calcutta, India."</p>

<p>Carl nearly fell off the seat.</p>

<p>"Ach, du lieber!" he sputtered, "I vas ketching my
breat'. A clue, py shinks! Dot Haidee knows vere der
fife-t'ousant-tollar girl iss, I bed you!"</p>

<p>"Knows where the girl is?" echoed Matt.</p>

<p>"Sure t'ing. How vouldt Haidee haf Markaret Manners'
ledders oof she ditn't know somet'ing aboudt der
English girl? A few more knocks, py shiminy, und I
vill make der fife t'ousant tollars!"</p>

<p>"Carl," said Matt, "you've got a wooden head when
it comes to sleuthing. Why, Haidee is Margaret Manners
herself. I've had a hunch to that effect for two
or three hours."</p>

<p>Once more Carl had to hold on with both hands to
keep from going by the board. He could only breathe
hard and think of what he would do with all the money
that was coming to him.</p>

<p>"What else is there in the box, Joe?" asked Matt.
"Anything but the letters?"</p>

<p>"Just one thing, pard," replied McGlory. "It looks
like a decoration of some kind."</p>

<p>McGlory held the object over Matt's shoulder, so he
could see it.</p>

<p>It was a bronze Maltese cross, with a royal crown
in the centre surmounted by a lion, and the words "For
Valour" stamped on the cross under the crown. The
cross hung from a V-shaped piece attached to a bar,
and the bar was attached to a faded red ribbon. Across
the bar was engraved the name "Lionel Manners."</p>

<p>"I feel like taking off my hat in the presence of that,
pards," said Matt.</p>

<p>"Why?" demanded Joe.</p>

<p>"It's a Victoria Cross," returned Matt, "and is only
given to persons for a deed of gallantry and daring.
When the ribbon is red, it shows that the winner of the
cross belonged to the army; when blue, to the navy.
Captain Lionel Manners must have been a brave man,
and it's a pity his daughter should be treated as she has
been. Carl, you've blundered onto a big thing&mdash;and
you couldn't have blundered so successfully once in a
thousand times. Put the letters and the cross back in
the box, Joe. We'll keep them safe for the girl.
If&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dere's der blace," interrupted Carl, pointing to the
roadside.</p>

<p>Motor Matt brought the automobile to a stop.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE HYPNOTIST'S VICTIM.</p>


<p>"You and I will go and look for the Hindoos, Joe,"
said Matt, getting out of the car. "Carl will stay here
and take care of the automobile."</p>

<p>"Vat oof der Hindoos ged avay from you und come
ad me?" queried Carl, in a panic. "I bed you dey
vas sore ofer vat I dit."</p>

<p>"If they should happen to attack you," answered
Matt, "run away from them. You used to know something
about driving a car, Carl."</p>

<p>"All righdt," said Carl, with deep satisfaction. "I'll
run avay from some drouples oof any come in my
tirection. Look oudt for Ben Ali. He has a knife."</p>

<p>Matt and McGlory, after securing a few further directions
from Carl, started into the woods on their way to
the creek. They moved warily in single file, Matt taking
the lead.</p>

<p>As they made their way onward, they saw evidences of
Carl's wild dash for the road in the runabout, broken
bushes and trees blazed at about the height of a buggy
axle.</p>

<p>"It's a wonder that runabout wasn't strung all the
way from the creek to the road," murmured McGlory.
"The Dutchman's luck has landed on him all in a
bunch."</p>

<p>"Carl has a knack for blundering in the right direction,"
said Matt. "But he has as much grit as you'll
find in any lad of his size. Think how he fooled that
Ben Ali! Made the Hindoo believe he was hypnotized."</p>

<p>"And Carl had only the faintest notion what he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
doing it for!" chuckled McGlory. "Say, pard, I'd like
to have seen those Hindoos when Carl woke up and
used the whip on that horse of Burton's."</p>

<p>"Hist!" warned Matt, "we're close to the creek."</p>

<p>There were evidences in plenty that the bank of the
creek had been recently occupied&mdash;broken bushes and
an imprint of human feet in the damp soil. As Matt
and McGlory had supposed, however, there was no sign
of Haidee or the Hindoos in the vicinity.</p>

<p>"Here's where we're up a stump, pard," said McGlory.
"I wonder if I could pick up the trail and find which
way the outfit went?"</p>

<p>"Try it," said Matt.</p>

<p>McGlory skirmished around for ten minutes.</p>

<p>"I reckon I've got it," he announced, at the end of
that time. "Unless I'm far wide of my trail, Matt, they
went down the creek."</p>

<p>"Then that's the direction for us. Step off, Joe, and
be lively."</p>

<p>Although the boys believed the Hindoos and Haidee
must be far in advance of them, yet they moved forward
cautiously, being exceedingly careful not to rustle the
bushes as they passed or to step on any twigs that
would crackle under their feet.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, they had not been five minutes
on their way down the creek before the cowboy whirled
abruptly with a finger on his lips; then, motioning to
Matt, he dropped to his knees.</p>

<p>Matt followed suit and crept alongside McGlory.</p>

<p>"We're in luck, too," whispered the cowboy. "They're
right ahead of us, all three of them. Listen, and you
can hear them talking."</p>

<p>Matt raised his head and listened intently. A faint
sound of voices was borne to his ears.</p>

<p>"Let's creep up on them, Joe," he suggested. "They're
two against us, you know, and they'll make a pretty big
handful, if they're armed."</p>

<p>"We know Ben Ali has a knife, but that is probably
all the weapons they've got. If they had guns, then
Carl would never have made his getaway."</p>

<p>Redoubling their caution, the boys crawled forward,
screening their advance by keeping bunches of undergrowth
in front of them as much as they could.</p>

<p>The voices grew steadily louder, until it became manifest
that the brown men were jabbering in Hindustani.</p>

<p>Finally the boys arrived as close as they deemed it
best to go, for they had Ben Ali, Aurung Zeeb, and
Haidee in plain view.</p>

<p>The three were in a little oak opening on the creek
bank. Haidee was sitting on a log, and the other two
were standing and talking rapidly.</p>

<p>A moment after the boys were able to see them and
note what was going on, the Hindoos stopping their
talking. Aurung Zeeb drew off to one side, and Ben
Ali stepped in front of the girl.</p>

<p>"Haidee, <i>meetoowah</i>!" he called.</p>

<p>The girl lifted her head.</p>

<p>"You must go into de trance, <i>meetoowah</i>," said Ben
Ali.</p>

<p>With a heart-breaking cry the girl flung herself on her
knees in front of him.</p>

<p>"No, no, Uncle Ben!" she wailed, "don't make me do
things I can't remember&mdash;things I don't want to do!
What happened during the parade this morning? And
what happened while I was in the air with Motor Matt?
You will not tell me and I do not know! Oh, Uncle
Ben&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Haidee!"</p>

<p>The voice was clear and keen cut. There was something
in the tones of it that lifted the girl erect and
uncomplaining, and held her as by a magnet with her
eyes on the snaky, dancing orbs of Ben Ali.</p>

<p>The power of the Hindoo over the girl must have
been tremendous.</p>

<p>The boys, shivering with horror, watched the Hindoo
as he waved his arms gracefully and made his sinuous
passes. He was no more than a minute or two in effecting
his work.</p>

<p>By swift degrees Haidee's face lost its expression
and became as though graven from stone; her eyes grew
dull and her whole manner listless.</p>

<p>"Haidee, you sleep," came monotonously from Ben
Ali, as his hands dropped. "You hear me, <i>meetoowah</i>?
You understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the girl, in the clacking, parrot-like
voice with which the boys were somewhat familiar.</p>

<p>"You are never to remember, <i>meetoowah</i>, what you do
in de parade, or what you do on de flying machine,"
continued Ben Ali. "When you wake, you forget all
that, and how I tell you to pull the lever when de
parade reach de min'ral well, or pin de fireball as it
smoulder to de wing of de machine. You forget all that,
huh?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You are bright, lively girl, <i>meetoowah</i>" went on the
Hindoo. "You are gay, happy, but you are under de
power, yes, all de time. You go back to de show, and
you tell them that Ben Ali and Aurung Zeeb ver' bad
mans and run away with Haidee, that you make de
escape. Then you get from Boss Burton the money he
owe and come to Linton Hotel in Lafayette sometime
this night. You understand, <i>meetoowah</i>?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you not let anybody know you come to Linton
Hotel, <i>meetoowah</i>."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"And at all time when you wake you forget you was
Margaret Manners, and you remember all time when you
wake that you only Haidee."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Also, you try get back de box that b'long to you, de
little lacquered box. Remember that, Haidee. Get de
box if you can and bring it with de money to Uncle
Ben Ali at de Linton Hotel in Lafayette."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you all time forget when you wake dat you
Margaret Manners, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Something happened to the hypnotist, right then and
there.</p>

<p>Unable to endure longer the scene transpiring under
their eyes, the boys had crept forward until they were
close to Ben Ali and Aurung Zeeb.</p>

<p>Matt, behind Ben Ali, arose suddenly and caught the
Hindoo by the shoulders, flinging him down on his back
and holding him there with both hands about his throat.</p>

<p>McGlory, it had been planned, should make a simultaneous
attack, in the same manner, upon Aurung Zeeb;
but that individual was keener-eyed than his companion.
He saw McGlory just as the cowboy was about to spring.
With a loud cry of warning, Aurung Zeeb broke away in
a panic and fled into the timber.</p>

<p>McGlory did not follow him. Ben Ali, choking and
wriggling under the tense fingers of the king of the
motor boys, had made a desperate effort and drawn his
knife. The cowboy had glimpsed the blade, shimmering
in a gleam of sun, and had leaped forward and
caught the Hindoo's hand.</p>

<p>"We've got the scoundrel!" exulted McGlory. "I
reckon this is the last stunt of this sort he'll ever lay
hand to."</p>

<p>Ben Ali tried to speak. Matt saw the attempt and
removed his rigid fingers from the prisoner's throat,
slipping his hands down and gripping one of the man's
arms.</p>

<p>"Hold his other arm, Joe," panted Matt. "I want to
talk with him. I've got to talk with him. A great
wrong has been done Haidee, and if it is righted Ben
Ali is the only one to do it."</p>

<p>McGlory was puzzled, but yielded immediate obedience.</p>

<p>"Look at the girl," he whispered, as he laid both
hands on the prisoner's other arm.</p>

<p>There was a look of sharp pain in Haidee's face. Her
hands were clutching her throat, and she was swaying
where she stood.</p>

<p>"Haidee feel what you do to me," gurgled Ben Ali.
"You hurt me, you hurt her. You do not understand
de power."</p>

<p>"He's talkin' with two tongues!" declared McGlory.</p>

<p>"No," said Matt, "he tells the truth. As I told you,
Joe, we've got to make use of the scoundrel for Haidee's
benefit. Don't mind Haidee&mdash;she'll be all right by the
time we are through with Ben Ali."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">"FOR THE SAKE OF HAIDEE!"</p>


<p>Motor Matt knew something about hypnotism, having
acquired the knowledge in the casual way most boys
learn about such occult and, at times, fascinating subjects.</p>

<p>The young motorist knew, for instance, that if it was
suggested to Margaret Manners often enough in a hypnotic
state that she was only Haidee, the girl would
come to forget her own personality. Even when out of
the trance she would be confused and bewildered in trying
to recall her real name and her past life.</p>

<p>It was to undo some of this evil that Matt was eager
for a talk with the Hindoo.</p>

<p>"Ben Ali," said Matt sternly, "we have the box of
letters and Captain Manners' Victoria Cross. In order
to make you suffer terribly for what you have done, we
have only to turn you over to the authorities and let
them cable to London. There is a thousand pounds
sterling offered as a reward for the recovery of Margaret
Manners; and for you there would be a long term in
prison. You understand that, don't you?"</p>

<p>There was a crafty look on the Hindoo's face as he
answered.</p>

<p>"Yes, sahib. But you not do anything with me. De
girl is in de trance. I have her in my power."</p>

<p>"And we have you in our power," said Matt, appreciating
to the full the strong hold Ben Ali had on them,
as well as on the girl.</p>

<p>"But, by and by, when we have finished de talk, de
young sahib will let me go."</p>

<p>Matt was deeply thoughtful for a few moments.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered deliberately, "if you will answer
my questions, and do what I tell you to do, we will let
you go."</p>

<p>"Pard!" remonstrated Joe.</p>

<p>"I know what I am doing, Joe," returned Matt.</p>

<p>"De young sahib is wise," put in the smiling Ben Ali,
his eyes beginning to gleam and dance in an attempt to
get the king of the motor boys under their influence.</p>

<p>"Pah!" murmured Matt disgustedly. "You can hold
his arm with one hand, Joe. Place the other hand over
his eyes."</p>

<p>"He's a fiend," growled McGlory, as his palm dropped
over the upper part of Ben Ali's face.</p>

<p>The Hindoo laughed noiselessly.</p>

<p>"Will you talk with me frankly and answer my questions,
Ben Ali," proceeded Matt, "providing we promise
to let you go?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sahib."</p>

<p>"Then, first, who are you?"</p>

<p>"De brother of a great rajah in my own land, and de
brother of de great rajah's sister. That sister married de
Captain Manners, Margaret's father."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>"I see," breathed Matt, his eyes wandering to the girl.</p>

<p>Haidee had grown quiet, her face expressionless and
her eyes staring and vacant, as before.</p>

<p>"I, with my rich rajah brother," continued Ben Ali,
with bitterness, "was only de driver of his elephants.
No more. I work. He live in luxury and do not anything.
Captain Manners die. Then his wife, she die,
too. <i>Suttee.</i> She burn on de funeral pyre, as our custom
is in my land. De husband die, then de widow die.
Margaret she live. My brother, de rajah, give me
money, send me to Calcutta after Margaret. I go. I
get de girl and we take ship to America. Hah! On de
way I tell Margaret it is her uncle, de rajah's wish,
that she go to de Vassar school in America, that I follow
order when I take her there. She believe what I say.
On de steamer I begin de trances. She not like them,
but she agree at first. By and by she not able to help
herself. I tell her she not remember who she is when
she wake, that she only Haidee. She b'leeve." The
scoundrel laughed. "I have de so great power with the
eyes and the hands, sahib."</p>

<p>"Why did you join a show and take the girl with
you?" demanded Matt, a feeling of horror and repulsion
for Ben Ali growing in his heart.</p>

<p>"I have to live, sahib. My money give out. I know
how to drive de elephant, so I hear of de show and go
there. Boss Burton hire me. I speak of Haidee. He
hire her, too."</p>

<p>"Did she know how to perform on the trapeze&mdash;she,
the niece of a powerful rajah and daughter of an English
gentleman?"</p>

<p>"She know not anything about that. I put her in de
trance and tell her she know. Then she perform on de
trapeze better than any."</p>

<p>"Why did you want her to go up on the flying machine?"</p>

<p>"Cut it short," growled McGlory huskily. "I feel
like using the knife on the villain, pard. He ain't fit
to live."</p>

<p>"You listened to me while I was talking with my
friends in the calliope tent this morning," continued Matt.
"Why was that?"</p>

<p>"I was afraid of de Dutch boy," answered Ben Ali,
"and I was more afraid when I hear what he tell.
After that, I be afraid of all of you. You understan'?
I thought you take Haidee away from me."</p>

<p>"You hypnotized her before the parade and told her
to do something to make me trouble?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sahib," was the prompt response. "I wanted you
out of de way. I was afraid."</p>

<p>"Scoundrel!" muttered Matt. "Why, you placed Haidee
herself in danger."</p>

<p>"I was Rajah's mahout. I could have kept de elephant
from hurting Haidee."</p>

<p>"Was she hypnotized when she came to the aëroplane
and played that trick to go up in the machine with me?"</p>

<p>"She was, yes, sahib."</p>

<p>"And you gave her something to be used in setting
the aëroplane afire?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sahib. It was de smouldering fire ball, with de
coal in its heart. When de machine go up, and de win'
fan it, den by and by it break into flame and set fire to
de machine."</p>

<p>Ben Ali was frank, brutally frank. But he had Motor
Matt's promise that he should go free, and he seemed to
gloat over his evil deeds and to wish that not a detail
be left out.</p>

<p>"She did not act, when she was in the aëroplane, as
she did when she was in the parade," said Matt.</p>

<p>"I make her act different, sahib. I tell her how she
was to be. I have de so great power I do that. Other
fakirs not so great as Ben Ali."</p>

<p>"We've heard enough," said Matt. "Now, as yet, you
have only partly earned your freedom, Ben Ali. You
have still to do what I shall tell you."</p>

<p>"What is that, sahib?"</p>

<p>"You will, by the aid of hypnotism, undo all the evil
you have done, as much as possible. For instance, you
will impress on Haidee, as she stands there, the truth
that she is Margaret Manners, and that she will remember
it, and all her past, when she wakes. After that,
you are to waken her and take yourself off."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the Hindoo. "My freedom is dear
to me. Perhaps"&mdash;and he smiled&mdash;"I have something yet
to do with Motor Matt."</p>

<p>"If you cross my path again, Ben Ali," returned the
king of the motor boys, "there will be no promise binding
me to let you go free. If you are wise, you will
stay away from me and my friends, and from Haidee."</p>

<p>"I take my chance, if that is it. To awaken Haidee
I must be on my feet."</p>

<p>"You will lie as you are!" declared Matt sharply.
"You can do your work as well this way as in any
other."</p>

<p>"I will try," said the Hindoo, after a moment's pause.
Then, in a loud voice, he called: "Haidee!"</p>

<p>The girl turned her eyes upon him.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered.</p>

<p>"When you wake, <i>meetoowah</i>, you will remember that
you are Margaret Manners."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You will remember all, everything&mdash;Calcutta, your
father, Captain Manners, your mother, your mother's
brother, de rajah. But you forget Ben Ali, and you
think no more of him. You understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>This, in a little different language, Ben Ali repeated
several times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, young sahib," said he, "let me up till I wake
Haidee."</p>

<p>"Hold to him on that side, Joe," cautioned Matt, "but
give him the use of his hands. When Haidee wakes,
release him."</p>

<p>"Sufferin' fairy tales!" grumbled McGlory. "I hate to
do it, pard, and that's honest, but I reckon, from what
I've heard, that you know what you're about. It's a
hard way to bring right and justice to the girl by letting
this scoundrel escape the law, but there don't seem
to be anything else for it."</p>

<p>Slowly the boys got up and permitted Ben Ali to
struggle to his feet. When he was erect, both still
gripped him by the waist in order to prevent him from
committing any treachery.</p>

<p>Ben Ali leaned forward and waved his hands.</p>

<p>"Awake, <i>meetoowah</i>!" he called sharply. "You are
yourself again, Margaret Manners! Awake!"</p>

<p>The girl started, and lifted both hands to her temples.
It was enough, and Motor Matt was satisfied.</p>

<p>"Let him go, Joe," said Matt, "but keep his knife."</p>

<p>The boys, at the same moment, withdrew their hands
and stepped back. Ben Ali, with a wild, snarling laugh,
sprang into the woods and vanished.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Margaret Manners, in a puzzled
voice. "Where am I? Ah, is that you, Motor Matt?
And Joe!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sis," returned the cowboy, his voice full of gentleness,
"it's your friend McGlory, and the best friend
you ever had if you did but know it&mdash;Motor Matt."</p>

<p>"Come," said Matt briskly, "we must hustle back to
the automobile. Carl will have a fit wondering what
has become of us."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE RAJAH'S NIECE.</p>


<p>The events of that wonderful day all seemed like a
dream to Motor Matt when he came to look back on
them. The coming of Carl, loaded with a joke sprung
upon him by the detectives in Chicago&mdash;a joke, by the
way, that proved a boomerang&mdash;and the dangers and
perils that trailed after the Dutch boy and finally ended
in most marvelous success&mdash;all these seemed but the figments
of disordered fancy.</p>

<p>But the damaged aëroplane remained to tell of the
dangers, and Carl was there in the flesh, and Margaret
Manners was present, freed of the evil shadow that had
blighted her young life.</p>

<p>The afternoon performance had been over for some
time when Matt, Joe, Carl, and Margaret&mdash;for now she
must be Margaret and not Haidee&mdash;returned to the
show grounds.</p>

<p>The owner of the motor car was walking up and
down in fretful mood, thinking, perhaps, that he had
done a most unwise thing in letting his machine get out
of his hands.</p>

<p>Burton was with him and seeking to pacify his fears.
But the sight of the motor car alone did that.</p>

<p>"Well," exclaimed Burton, "you've got one of 'em,
Matt. She is the most valuable of the lot, to me. Where
are the other two?"</p>

<p>"They escaped," answered Matt shortly. "And Haidee,
Mr. Burton, is no longer an employee of the Big
Consolidated."</p>

<p>"What!" cried Burton. "Do you mean to say she
isn't going up on the aëroplane any more, and that she'll
not touch off Roman candles or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I told you she'd never do that, some time ago," said
Matt keenly.</p>

<p>Burton seemed to have a way of forgetting the things
he did not want to hear.</p>

<p>"Well, anyhow," went on the showman, as soon as
they had all alighted, and the owner of the car had got
into it and tooted joyfully away, "come to the mess tent
and tell me what happened."</p>

<p>"Haven't time, Burton," said Matt. "Miss Manners
is going to the best hotel in town, and I've got some
telegrams to send."</p>

<p>"Telegrams?" Burton pricked up his ears and showed
signs of excitement. "There isn't another show trying
to hire you away from me, is there? Don't forget your
written contract, Matt!"</p>

<p>"I'm not forgetting that," returned Matt, inclined to
laugh. "The telegram I am going to send is to the
British ambassador at Washington, and the cablegram
I am going to get on the wires is to an attorney in
London, England."</p>

<p>"Jupiter!" exclaimed Burton. "It looks to me as
though you wouldn't get through in time to go on with
section two of the show train."</p>

<p>"We won't," continued Matt, "and that's what I'm
going to tell you about. We'll be a couple of days
making repairs on the aëroplane, and we'll make them
here. After the work is done, we'll join the Big Consolidated
at the town where it happens to be at that
time."</p>

<p>"Your contract, sir!" fumed Burton. "You are&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No repairs on the aëroplane would have been necessary,"
interrupted Motor Matt, "if you had not played
that trick on me and substituted Haidee for Le Bon.
Just remember that. I shall expect you to pay the bills
for the repairs, too."</p>

<p>Burton received these remarks in silence.</p>

<p>"When I and my friends are ready to join you," went
on the king of the motor boys, "we'll go by air line in
the <i>Comet</i>, and if you have any good paper, we'll scatter
it all along the route. It will be the biggest kind of an
advertisement for you, Burton."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>This was a master stroke, if Burton yearned for one
thing more than another, it was to make his name a
household word.</p>

<p>"Great!" he cried. "But you won't be more than two
days here, will you, Matt?"</p>

<p>"We'll try not to be."</p>

<p>"And you'll scatter the paper?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"Fine! I'll have it for you. Where'll I send it?"</p>

<p>"To the Bramble House."</p>

<p>"It will be there. Make the bill for repairs as light
as possible, and draw on me for the amount. That's
fair, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"Just about."</p>

<p>"Ask anybody and they'll tell you Boss Burton is the
soul of honesty, and that every promise he makes in his
paper is carried out to the letter. What will you do
with the aëroplane?"</p>

<p>"McGlory and Ping will look after it to-night. Tomorrow
they will have it removed to some place where
we can work on it comfortably."</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;have it your way. I'm the easiest fellow
to get along with that you ever saw, when I see a chap
is going to treat me square. Good luck to you&mdash;to all
of you."</p>

<p>The party separated. McGlory went over into the
show grounds to join Ping at the aëroplane, and Matt
and Carl escorted Miss Manners to the Bramble House.
Carl went to the show, when the tents were being pulled
down that night, and got Miss Manners' trunk and his
own clothes from the calliope tent. Carl, it will be recalled,
was wearing McGlory's work clothes, and McGlory
was going to need them.</p>

<p>Most of the luggage belonging to Matt and his
friend went on by train with the show impedimenta, to
be reclaimed at some town farther along the route.</p>

<p>Matt sent his telegram and his cablegram, and in
neither did he conceal the fact that all the glory of the
achievement belonged to Carl Pretzel.</p>

<p>The Dutch boy was terribly set up over his success.
Until far into the night he kept Matt up, trying to
find out what he should do with his five thousand dollars.
Carl was about evenly divided, in his opinions, as
to whether he should buy an aëroplane of his own, or a
circus. Matt discouraged him on both points.</p>

<p>Next morning the <i>Comet</i>, under its own power,
dragged its battered pinions to a big blacksmith shop,
and there the motor boys got actively to work on the
repairs.</p>

<p>The damage was confined almost entirely to the canvas
covering the left wing. None of the supports were
injured.</p>

<p>In two days' time the aëroplane was as good as new.
At the close of the second day, when Matt and McGlory
reached the hotel with their work finished, so far as
the <i>Comet</i> was concerned, they found an English gentleman
who represented the British embassy.</p>

<p>This gentleman had come, personally, to assume
charge of Miss Manners; and, by this very act, the boys
understood that the young woman was something of a
personage.</p>

<p>The Englishman said nothing about the reward, and
Carl began to worry. Finally he broached the subject
himself, only to learn that the five thousand dollars
must come from India, and that it would be a month,
possibly two months, before it could be turned over.</p>

<p>Carl was disgusted. He had expected to have the
money all spent before two months had passed.</p>

<p>"Dot's der vay mit der tedectif pitzness," he remarked
gloomily. "Even ven you vin you don't get nodding."</p>

<p>"But you're bound to get it, Carl," laughed McGlory,
"sooner or later."</p>

<p>"Meppy so mooch lader dot I vill be olt und gray-heated
und not know nodding aboudt how to shpend him.
How vas I going to lif in der meandime, huh? Tell me
dose."</p>

<p>"Come along with us," said Matt, "and stay with the
Big Consolidated until your money comes."</p>

<p>"I don'd like dot Purton feller," growled Carl. "He
iss der vorst case oof stingy vat I efer see. Shdill, id
iss vort' someding to be mit Modor Matt. Yah, so
helup me, I vill go."</p>

<p>Ping was not in love with this arrangement, but had
to bow to it.</p>

<p>The gentleman from Washington took the next train
back to the capital, arranging to have Miss Manners
left in the care of an estimable lady in Lafayette until
word should come from India.</p>

<h2><a name="SAVED_BY_A_FALLING_TREE" id="SAVED_BY_A_FALLING_TREE">SAVED BY A FALLING TREE.</a></h2>


<p>Winter still reigned, and Louis and Allen Wright were
snowshoeing back to the lumber camp where they worked.</p>

<p>It was a small camp upon the Tobago River, near the Ottawa,
close to the border between the Provinces of Ontario
and Quebec, and the pine had for the most part been cut
long ago. There was a little pine left, however, with a good
deal of pulp wood and mixed timber to be got out, and the
foreman had sent the boys to look over a patch of spruce
about twelve miles from the shanty. They were returning
with their axes upon the frozen Tobago River, which formed
a convenient roadway through the tangled and snowy Canadian
forest.</p>

<p>The boys were not professional "lumber jacks," but they
were both deeply desirous of acquiring a couple of hundred
dollars to cover the expenses of a course in mining engineering,
and that winter high wages were being offered for even
inexperienced men in the lumber camps.</p>

<p>As they were country-bred youths, they took to the work
naturally, and Allen, although he had not yet come to his
full strength, speedily developed a surprising dexterity with
the axe. He could "lay" a tree within a few inches of where
he desired it to fall, and had been the instrument of victory
several times in lumbering matches with rival camps.</p>

<p>It was late in February and still bitterly cold, but the deep
snow was packing and softening. In a few weeks the ice
might break up, and mountains of logs were piled upon the
river in readiness for the drive.</p>

<p>About three miles before it reached the shanty the river
broke into rapids for about thirty rods before it fell tumultuously
over a low ridge of rocks.</p>

<p>It was necessary to make a detour round this obstacle, and
Allen went ashore at a cautious distance from the water.
Louis, however, remained upon the ice, walking almost to
the verge, and looking over into the inky stream.</p>

<p>"Be careful, Lou! That ice is getting rotten!" Allen
shouted from the bank.</p>

<p>"It's as strong as rock. Look!" answered Louis, jumping
in his rackets with a heavy thud upon the snow.</p>

<p>He proved the reverse of what he intended. There was a
dull cracking under the snow and a startled shout from the
reckless snowshoer. A great cake of ice broke off, drifting
away, with Louis standing on it. He balanced unsteadily for
a moment, staggered, and plunged off with a terrified yell,
going clean out of sight under the icy water.</p>

<p>The cake of ice drifted over the rapids and broke up.
Allen had scarcely time to move before his brother reappeared,
struggling feebly, and evidently almost paralyzed
by the cold immersion. By good luck he managed to catch
the top of a projecting rock at the head of the fall, and there
he clung, driven against the rock by the force of the current.</p>

<p>"Hold on a minute, Lou! I'll get you out!" screamed
Allen frantically. Louis turned a blue face toward him,
without answering.</p>

<p>Allen tore and kicked off his snowshoes, and was on the
point of plunging into the water; but common sense returned
to him in time. Louis was in the middle of the
stream, thirty feet away. Allen could never reach him through
that swift, deep current, and if he could, he would be so
chilled as to be incapable of giving any sort of help.</p>

<p>But the boy certainly could not hold on long in his present
position, and should he let go he would be swept over the
rapids and under the ice at the foot. His life hung on seconds.</p>

<p>Allen could think of no plan. He shouted encouraging
words without knowing what he said, while his eyes roved
desperately up and down the snowy shores in search of some
inspiration.</p>

<p>If he had only a rope, or anything to make a bridge&mdash;and
then his eye fell upon a tall, dead pine "stub," barkless and
almost branchless, standing a few feet back from the stream.</p>

<p>It was long enough to reach to the imperiled youth, if it
could be felled so accurately as to lie close beside him. But
a foot or two above or below him would make it useless, and
to aim too closely would be to run a deadly risk of crushing
the boy under the falling trunk.</p>

<p>By a queer vagary of his excited brain he remembered
William Tell and the apple. He would have to perform a
somewhat similar feat of marksmanship; but it was the only
chance that he could think of. He plunged through the
snow for his axe, wallowed back to the dead stub, and began
to chop.</p>

<p>In the need for action his nerves grew suddenly cool. The
feat was a more delicate one than he had ever attempted,
and his brother's life hung upon his steadiness of nerve and
muscle. But he cut quietly and without haste. The great
yellow chips flew, and a wide notch grew in the trunk.</p>

<p>In a few moments he shifted to the other side, cut another
notch, and sighted for the probable direction of the fall of
the stub. He could not tell how the roots held. He would
have to leave that important factor to chance, but he cut,
now delicately, now strongly, till the tremor through the axe
handle told that the trunk was growing unsteady.</p>

<p>It was a critical moment. He sighted again most carefully,
and cut out a few small chips here and there. The
stub tottered. It was standing poised upon a thin edge of
uncut wood, and he stood behind it and pushed, cautiously,
and then heavily.</p>

<p>The tall trunk wavered, and the fibres snapped loudly. It
hesitated, bowed, and Allen leaped away from the butt.
Down came the pine, roaring through the air.</p>

<p>It crashed into the water with a mighty wave and splash
that hid boy and rock. Allen had a moment of horrified
belief that his brother had been crushed under it. A moment
later he saw that Louis was unhurt. But the tree had actually
grazed the rock. It had fallen within eight inches of
the boy's body.</p>

<p>It made a perfect bridge as it lay, but in his nervous reaction
Allen was almost too shaky to walk the trunk and pull
his brother out. He did it, although how he got him to land
he never quite knew. Louis was almost unconscious, and
his wet clothes froze instantly into a mass of ice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>He would certainly have lapsed into sleep and died, but
Allen piled the pine chips about the stump and had a fire
blazing in a few seconds. The dry stump burned like pitch,
producing a furnace-like heat; and Allen partly undressed
his brother and rubbed him hard with snow. Under this
heroic treatment Louis came back to painful consciousness,
and the fierce heat from the pine did the rest. But it was
several hours before he was able to resume the tramp, and it
was dark when they reached the shanty.</p>

<h2><a name="How_They_Captured_the_Python" id="How_They_Captured_the_Python">How They Captured the Python.</a></h2>


<p>Hamburg, as many know, is the great headquarters of the
trade in wild animals for menageries and "zoos." To Hamburg
are shipped lions, elephants, and giraffes, captured in
South and East Africa, tigers from India, jaguars and tapirs
from South America, gorillas from the Congo, orang-outangs
from Borneo, and, in fact, about every kind of beast, bird,
and reptile from all quarters of the globe.</p>

<p>The warehouses of the two principal firms engaged in this
business are interesting places to visit after the arrival of a
"beast ship," with news of unusually large specimens of
animal life.</p>

<p>The narrator made such a visit some months ago on the
arrival of a remarkably large, brilliantly marked python,
shipped from Padang, Sumatra. This colubrine giant is
more than thirty feet in length, and was bespoken by the
Austrian government for a zoo at Budapest.</p>

<p>But the story of its capture is even more interesting than
the huge creature itself, for this python had fallen a victim
to its fondness for the notes of a violin.</p>

<p>There is a telegraph line extending across Sumatra, from
Padang, connecting that port, by means of submarine cables,
with Batavia, and Singapore.</p>

<p>Along this line of land wire are a number of interior stations.
One of these, called Pali-lo-pom, has been in charge
of an operator named Carlos Gambrino, a mestizo from
Batavia, Java, educated at the industrial school there.</p>

<p>The station is on a hillock in the valley of the River
Kampar, and is adjacent to dense forest, jungle, and a long
morass. It is a solitary little place, consisting merely of
four or five thatched huts, elevated on posts to a height of six
feet from the ground, to be more secure from noxious insects,
reptiles, and wild beasts.</p>

<p>As a general rule Gambrino has little enough to do, except
listen to the monotonous ticking of the instrument. For
solace and company, therefore, he frequently had recourse
to his violin.</p>

<p>Thatched houses on posts in Sumatra are not commonly
supplied with glass windows; but Gambrino had afforded
himself the luxury of a two-pane sash, set to slide in an
aperture in the side wall of his hut, and some five or six
months ago, during the wet season, he was sitting at this
window one afternoon, as he played his violin, when he saw
the head of a large serpent rise out of the high grass, at a
distance of seventy or eighty yards.</p>

<p>His first impulse was to get his carbine and try to shoot the
monster, for he saw that it was a very large python, and not
a desirable neighbor. But something in the attitude of the
reptile led him to surmise that it had raised itself to hear
the violin, and he passed at once to a lively air.</p>

<p>As long as he continued playing the python remained
there, apparently motionless; but when he ceased it drew
its head down, and he saw nothing more of it that day, although
he went out with his gun to look for it.</p>

<p>Nearly a fortnight passed, and the incident had gone from
his mind&mdash;for large snakes are not uncommon in Sumatra&mdash;when
one night, as he was playing the violin to some native
acquaintances who had come to the hut, they heard the
sounds made by a large snake sliding across the bamboo platform
or floor of the little veranda. On looking out with a
light, one of the party saw a huge mottled python gliding
away.</p>

<p>But it was not until the reptile appeared a third time, raising
its head near his window, that the telegrapher became
certain that it was really his violin which attracted it.</p>

<p>In the meantime the operator at Padang, with whom Gambrino
held daily conversations by wire, had told him that
the German agent of a Hamburg house at that port would
pay ten pounds, English money, for such a python as he
described.</p>

<p>Gambrino began scheming to capture the reptile. In one
of the huts at the station there was stored a quantity of
fibre rope, such as is used in Sumatra for bridging small
rivers and ravines.</p>

<p>Gambrino contrived three large nooses from this rope,
which he elevated horizontally, on bamboo poles, to the
height of his window, and carried the drawing ends of the
nooses inside the hut.</p>

<p>This was done after the operator had ascertained that at
times the snake would come about the house and raise its
head as if it heard the violin.</p>

<p>Some time later the python was beguiled by the music into
raising its head inside one of the nooses, which a native,
who was on the watch while Gambrino played, instantly
jerked tight.</p>

<p>What followed was exciting. The reptile resented the
trick with vigor, and showed itself possessed of far more
strength than they had expected.</p>

<p>The rope had been made fast to a beam inside, and the
snake nearly pulled the entire structure down, making it
rock and creak in a way that caused Gambrino and his
native ally to leap to the ground in haste from a back entrance.
The reptile coiled its body about the posts and pulled
desperately to break away. Altogether, it was a wild night
at this little remote telegraph station.</p>

<p>The next morning a crowd of natives collected; and as the
python had by this time exhausted itself, they contrived to
hoist its head as high as the roof of the hut and to secure
its tail.</p>

<p>It was then lowered into a molasses hogshead, which was
covered over and trussed up securely with ropes.</p>

<p>In this condition the python was drawn to Padang on a
bullock cart. It is said to weigh more than four hundred
pounds.</p>

<h2><a name="ON_THE_ROAD_TO_MANDALAY" id="ON_THE_ROAD_TO_MANDALAY">ON THE ROAD TO MANDALAY.</a></h2>


<p>All of us who were singing "On the Road to Mandalay" a
few years ago&mdash;and there were mighty few of us who let it
alone vocally&mdash;will be a bit surprised to be informed that
Rangoon, where the dawn comes up like thunder and other
interesting things happen, looks to the approaching tourist
like an up-to-date American business centre.</p>

<p>In fact, according to a writer, the capital of Burma has
many American towns beat a mile in the civic improvement
line. "Its electric-lighted highways, all broad, neatly paved
and well drained; its brilliantly illuminated boulevards, with
rows of graceful, well-trimmed trees bordering both sides;
its blocks of buildings, all laid out after a carefully considered
plan, showing little of architectural beauty but much of
austere regularity, astonish the stranger.</p>

<p>"When you take into consideration the fact that Rangoon
has a system of parks and parkways with beautiful shade
trees, choice flowers, and crystal lakes, artificial and natural,
dotted about them, and that it provides breathing spaces for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
people living in congested districts, you cannot but form a
good idea of the aliveness of the municipal corporation. A
good horse-carriage service, now being rapidly superseded
by the trolley, makes transportation easy and cheap. The
city has provided splendid schools and playgrounds. Yet
sixty years ago Rangoon was a mere fishing village."</p>

<p>One item from Mr. Kipling's picture of Rangoon referred
to the elephants hauling teakwood in "the slushy, squdgy
creek." Well, they are still at it, working with wonderful
precision and an apparent sense of responsibility. They don't
try to soldier, never get in one another's way or mixed up
with the machinery, no matter how cramped they may be for
room.</p>

<p>Some of them take the teak logs which have been floated
down the river and tow them ashore. Then they drag them
to the sawmills, either rolling them with one foot while they
walk on three, pushing them with their tusks, or pulling them
with a chain attached to a breast strap.</p>

<p>Inside the mill an elephant selects a log, picks it out with
his tusks, kicks it up to the saw with his toes, then tying
his trunk in a kind of knot around the log, holds it against
the teeth of the saw while it is made into boards, pushing
aside the outside slabs as they are cut off and adjusting the
log to make boards of the proper thickness.</p>

<p>Then he piles the boards up neatly, standing off to examine
the effect, and if he finds a board out of line carefully
adjusting it. Sometimes a pair of elephants working together
exchange peculiar grunts, as if they were giving and
receiving directions.</p>

<p>They are used in Burma for various purposes. The young
calves are ridden like horses, with a soft pad and stirrups.
They are found especially valuable in bad country, and may
be ridden fifty or sixty miles a day. A tap on the side of
the head, a slight pressure of the knee, or a word whispered
in the ear is all that is required to guide them.</p>

<p>It is not at all a difficult matter for an elephant in prime
condition to outrun a fast horse, but they cannot jump. A
deep ditch only six or seven feet wide is impassable to them.</p>

<p>Working elephants are in their prime when they are
twenty-five years old. They are expensive to feed, it being
declared in Rangoon that an elephant eats a quarter of his
weight in feed every day. An average day's food for one is
certainly eight hundred pounds.</p>

<p>Socially Burma is unlike other Oriental countries. Men
and women&mdash;even young men and women&mdash;walk together in
the streets and mingle in social gatherings. Courtship always
precedes the marriage.</p>

<p>The Burmans are ardent lovers, and when a young man
and woman find that their parents do not approve of the
match they usually repair to the woods and return after a
day or two as man and wife, sure of parental forgiveness.
Marriage among Burmans is an extremely simple affair.
The only ceremony performed is the eating together out of
the same bowl of rice. Usually a feast is given to the relatives
and friends of the families concerned. No sacrifices
are offered, no services are performed.</p>

<p>The Burman wears a smile on his countenance, laughs and
looks upon life through rose-colored spectacles. Both the
women and the men wear rich-hued silken clothes. But
while there is gayety there is no indecorum or impropriety.</p>

<p>For women Burma is a little heaven on earth, if we are
to believe enthusiastic writers. Mrs. Burman is ubiquitous.
Jewelry stores containing untold wealth in pearls, rubies,
and other gems are in charge of women. Markets and fruit
stalls are run by women.</p>

<p>At the railroad station a woman sells you the tickets and
another one is ready to take dictation and to do your type-writing.
Not long ago a woman stockbroker died leaving
a fortune which she had made herself. But the Burmese
woman does not let business interfere with motherhood.
She runs the shop with one hand and the children with the
other.</p>

<p>When she marries the woman retains her own name, and
any property she may have inherited or acquired. When divorced
she is expected to support her children, but this is
no hardship for her, since she cared for them when she lived
with her husband. The Burmese child rarely sees the father,
but is brought up to look to its mother for guidance and
support.</p>

<p>The Burmese woman takes a great interest in public affairs,
and the portals of the University of Rangoon have been
open to her for a number of years. Her intelligence, her
beauty, her freedom from racial caste prejudice, all make
her an acceptable bride in the eyes of foreigners who go to
Burma.</p>

<p>Marriage with a foreigner means as a rule that she can
live in plenty and comfort without working. Naturally she
looks upon such a marriage with favor. The Burmans are
of Mongolian origin, and consequently the Chinese and Burmese
marriage produces a virile race. With this exception
the intermixture of races in Burma has not proved desirable.</p>

<p>This is especially so in case of marriages between Europeans
and Burmans. The offspring of such marriages are
termed Eurasians, who unfortunately seem to be looked
down upon both by full-blooded Europeans and Burmans.</p>

<p>Almost as difficult a problem as that of the Eurasian is
the tobacco problem in Burma. Men, women, and children
smoke. The cheroot at which they almost incessantly puff
is eighteen inches long and about a quarter of an inch in
diameter. It is wrapped in a banana leaf, and its mouthpiece
consists of bamboo. The Burman tobacco is so strong
that only one-fourth of the filling of the cheroot consists of
tobacco. The balance is a mixture of innocuous herbs.</p>

<p>If possible the Burman exceeds other Asiatics in hospitality.
He is par excellence the host of Asia. Any stranger
may stroll into a Burman dwelling and demand hospitality
for at least three days. No remuneration is expected. Opposite
a Burmese house one usually finds earthen pots of
water placed for the use of the traveler, under a roof especially
made to shelter the water from the hot rays of the
tropical sun. These pots are tightly covered with earthen
lids, which protect the water from dirt and dust.</p>

<p>The social life of the Burmans is interesting in the extreme.
They indulge in boxing matches, pony, bullock, and
boat races, cock fighting, splitting cocoanuts, snake charming,
and juggling. Chess and dominoes are the favorite games.
Theatres are in great vogue. The plot of the play is usually
somewhat monotonous, for almost invariably the hero is a
prince of the blood royal, the heroine is a princess, and the
rustics from the villages figure as clowns and jesters.</p>

<p>The dancing, though different from what it is in the Occident,
is not without interest to a Westerner. The motions
of the dancers are graceful and spry. Burman amusements
last days and nights. The best known secular festival is the
pwe.</p>

<p>The entertainment is melodramatic. Comedy and tragedy
are introduced, music and dancing are included. The plot of
the play is flimsy. The performance includes tricks of
clowns who are masters of their art and intensely amusing.
The musical instruments in the orchestra consist of a circle
of drums, gongs, trumpets, and wooden clappers, and the
music out-Wagners Wagner in its deafening noise.</p>

<p>Many religious festivals are celebrated. Probably the occasion
when presents are distributed to the priests is the
most interesting. The people bring their presents and pile
them up outside an alley made of bamboo latticework. One
brings candles, another matches, another brass vessels, etc.,
as though some previous arrangement had been made as to
just what each one shall give.</p>

<p>For the most part the donors are women, and all of them
are dressed in their best. The monks, attended by a boy carrying
a large basket, pass down the bamboo alley in single
file, and each basket is filled with presents. A trio of masqueraders
with faces blackened, dancing to comic music, follows
the procession. Anything that has not been distributed
to the priests is gathered up by them.</p>

interest of the stories, second only to those published in the Tip Top Weekly.</p>

<p>Matt has positive mechanical genius, and while his adventures are unusual, they are,

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
